Dozens of officers, some carrying assault rifles, advanced with a pair of armoured trucks on the young and predominantly African American crowd in Fergsuon, after two glass bottles were thrown at their lines from a largely peaceful protest against the shooting of Michael Brown, who was black, by an officer from the city's overwhelmingly white police department.

For hours, police snipers trained their weapons on demonstrators who protested with their hands up as an emblem of peaceful protest. When events escalated on a fourth night of tension in this city of just 21,000 people, protesters described being subjected to military-style tactics as they fled through gas-filled residential side-streets.

Police clearing the main drag of Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, also {arrested two reporters,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-arrest-reporters-as-unrest-continues-over-michael-brown-shooting""> including one from the Washington Post. Marty Baron, its editor, condemned the arrest as ""an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news"". The Huffington Post, whose reporter was also detained, said the {journalists were subjected to ""militant aggression""}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/13/ryan-reilly-_n_5677060.html""> and treated as ""enemy combatants"". A camera crew from al-Jazeera America said they were shot by rubber bullets.

The White House said early on Thursday that Barack Obama had interrupted his vacation on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, to be briefed by the US attorney general, Eric Holder, on the escalating clashes between police and demonstrators.

The night's events were described as ""deeply troubling"" by Jay Nixon, Missouri's governor, who will visit the area on Thursday. ""While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern,"" he said.

Protesters were angry at the shooting of Brown on Saturday afternoon by a {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> city police officer, and at the response by authorities. Police have said the shooting followed an assault on the officer. But a friend who was walking with Brown said the 18-year-old was grabbed after declining a request to get on to the pavement, and then shot repeatedly as he tried to run away. The officer has still not been named. St Louis County police are investigating.

After standing guard as demonstrators gathered through the afternoon on Wednesday, the police began clearing West Florissant Avenue, Ferguson's main street, as the evening drew in. Just before 7pm, they evicted customers from a branch of McDonald's towards the eastern end of the street.

Inside, working, were reporters Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post. In statements, their publications said the pair were videoing and photographing the police actions and were then arrested and handcuffed as they tried to leave. The reporters were eventually released after spending about half an hour in a cell.

""Police militarisation has been among the most consequential and unnoticed developments of our time, and it is now beginning to affect press freedom,"" said Ryan Grim, the Huffington Post's Washington bureau chief.

At least 10 people were arrested in all, according to police, including Antonio French, a St Louis city alderman who had been observing the protests and covering them on social media. French was reportedly charged with unlawful assembly.

At 8.40pm, at the other end of West Florissant, two bottles smashing prompted a furious reaction from the police line. Protesters were warned over a Tannoy to leave the area immediately or be arrested. ""Your peaceful protest is no longer peaceful,"" the police voice said.

When the protesters refused to retreat, a high-pitched siren blared from a police Swat truck and several canisters of teargas were fired towards the crowd in quick succession. ""Return to your vehicles, return to your homes,"" the police Tannoy said. Yet protesters regrouped, linked arms and continued to chant at the police, some screaming obscenities.

At 9.08pm, a barrage of gas canisters and flashbangs were shot at the crowds, prompting chaos. Many protesters ran south down Lang Drive. But, even as they fled, the police line continued to fire gas canisters and crackers in their direction. No one could be seen throwing anything at the officers.

Some canisters landed and emitted plumes of smoke in the front gardens of residents as they sat inside their homes. Others hit cars and trucks as people tried to escape.

""Our property value has gone down, our taxes have gone up and our insurance has gone up because St Louis County came out here shooting at these kids while they were sitting in the street,"" said one woman living on Lang Drive, who declined to be named. ""They started this.""

Rubber bullets were fired at people who remained on West Florissant. One young man, who had his arms aloft in the ""hands up – don't shoot"" gesture that has come to define these protests, was shot several times. After he fell to the ground, he was pounced on by several officers.

""They hit me on the hand with a teargas bomb,"" said Tony Giegers, 27. ""It exploded on me kind of like buckshot. It sprayed everywhere. It hit me there on my hand and burned my hand. It's burning right now, it's burning up."" His friend DeJuan, 19, said he was struck in the right leg.

A highly visible camera crew for al-Jazeera America reporting on the clashes said that they, too, were shot at with rubber bullets. The Guardian watched as a gas canister was fired directly at them as they attempted to record a piece to camera. The crew and their presenter fled.

""The police are responding with force, which you can understand to a certain degree,"" said Justin, a 29-year-old protester. ""But this amount of force was unwarranted. This is an abuse of force. No one is firing guns at them or running at them. This is an overreach.

""Were people yelling at them? Were people shouting obscenities? Yes, that's normal. But no one rioted, no one looted, no one threatened to harm anyone. This is getting out of control. It's like a military action.""

""They militarised the police in this small county in Missouri,"" said a man who gave his name as Kevvy. ""They got military trucks and people coming in from all over the state just for a protest at something they did.""

Brian Schellman, a spokesman for St Louis County police, told the Guardian at the law enforcement command centre late on Wednesday that chiefs would review tactics after the night's events. ""Our commanders are definitely going to review and see if we can do something better,"" he said. However Schellman said that the officers involved ""acted with great restraint"". ""Bottles were being thrown at them; we had molotov cocktails being thrown; we had a police officer break an ankle from a thrown brick. So when the assaults start coming on police officers that's the measures that are taken. We don't wanna have to use gas on anybody.""

Schellman said he could not say whether any bottles struck officers. However, he said, ""the fear of threat like that is still construed as an assault. Injury does not have to happen for an assault to happen.""

He said that police did not yet know whether they would repeat the tactics on Thursday if protesters turned out again, defying a request from the city to demonstrate only in daylight hours.

Some said they would. ""We got to retaliate to the force they are using,"" said Kevvy. ""If they try and hurt us we try and hurt them. That's just the way it is. People that live in this community, people out here for Mike Brown, people that's black.""",950,11300,Two reporters arrested as crackdown on demonstrations in St Louis following killing of unarmed black 18-year-old continues ,NA
Guardian,guard2,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-michael-brown-national-guard-deployed,Missouri national guard to be deployed at Ferguson protests,Jon Swaine; Rory Carroll,08/18/14,03/23/16,"The national guard in Missouri is to be deployed to the city of {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> after the most intense night of violence since the shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old, in which police used teargas against protesters hours before a midnight curfew came into effect.

Missouri’s governor, Jay Nixon, announced in the early hours of Monday that he had signed an executive order directing national guard troops to protect the northern suburb of St Louis from “deliberate, coordinated and intensifying violent attacks on lives and property in Ferguson.

“These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory, and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served, and to feel safe in their own homes.”

The escalation in the crisis came after the eighth night of unrest since Brown was killed by a police officer, Darren Wilson, in disputed circumstances on 9 August. An autopsy released as the clashes raged concluded that {Brown was shot six times, including twice in the head.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-michael-brown-shot-multiple-times-autopsy-shows-including-in-head"">

Bouts of gunfire rang out around Ferguson throughout Sunday night and early Monday morning. Three people were injured and a series of shops and restaurants were vandalised and looted. Heavily armed police repeatedly fired teargas and rubber bullets during running battles with the crowds. Several people were arrested for failing to disperse and journalists were detained and threatened by police with guns.

“Tonight, a Sunday that started with prayer and messages of unity, peace and justice, took a very different turn after dark,” Captain Ron Johnson of the {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> highway patrol, which controls the policing of the protests, said at a 1am press conference on Monday.

“I had no alternative but to elevate the level of our response. We had to act to protect lives and property,” he added.

Police launched their first barrage of gas and smoke at about 9pm on Sunday after fearing an advance on their command post – in a mall parking lot just south of the centre of the clashes – by a largely peaceful protest march, according to Johnson. He said several molotov cocktails were thrown by those taking part in the march, which included children.

This was sharply disputed. “You need to pull these officers back,” Renita Lamkin, an episcopal pastor who has been trying to control the protests, told a police chief by phone, as teargas fell on the march. “There were no molotov cocktails,” she said.

An unrelated shooting about 20 minutes later outside a branch of McDonald’s prompted a stampede of people down West Florissant Avenue, the main road where conflict has flared since Brown was killed. Almost immediately, police deployed more gas and smoke grenades.

“That stuff doesn’t feel good,” said West, 23, who had tears streaming from his eyes. He said his throat was burning. “You really feel like you’re going to die.”

Young men in bandanas taunted police, picking up gas canisters and throwing them back. One man picked up an item that landed near his feet and immediately threw it through the main window of McDonald’s, as staff and customers screamed inside. Another picked up a nearby rock and threw it into another of the restaurant’s windows. Staff hid in a back room.

Another 20 minutes on, police turned on a high-pitch siren and fired repeated rounds of stun grenades into the crowd along with an even bigger gas bombardment. Yet dozens of protesters continued advancing back through the flashes and the fog towards the police. Many carried bricks and kerb stones they had broken to throw at officers. Others hurled bottles.

Police drove protesters with more gas northwards towards a burned out petrol station that was looted last Sunday. Some protesters smashed the windows of a hair salon and a storage facility as they passed. Then a burst of gunfire was heard over the road from the petrol station, sending people scrambling to the ground.

Protesters said they had no intention of backing down. “This is a revo-fucking-lution,” said DeAndre Smith, a 30-year-old barber. “Plain and simple, this is the revolution. The one everybody was waiting on. It happened like this. It’s the gain in culture by a people who want respect. African American people in this country.

“I been out here since day one. I was on the frontline. Mike Brown was the straw that broke the camel’s back. That’s when we said this is enough. That’s it.”

Following a standoff at the petrol station, police sent remaining demonstrators scrambling into side streets by speeding at them in armoured Swat trucks, firing yet more gas and smoke at people running away. The trucks continued driving up and down the main street doing this until it was cleared. As some reached a branch of Domino’s pizza, there were two more bursts of gunshots.

In Dellwood, just north of Ferguson, several people were injured when a crowd fled in their cars from a grocery store that was apparently being looted when police arrived. The injured were taken to hospital. There were still more than 40 minutes to go before the second five-hour long nightly curfew ordered by Nixon came into effect. But by midnight, most streets were empty. Later still, a standoff involving police took place on the street on which Brown was shot dead.

News of the results of the autopsy by Dr Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner for New York, had begun circulating as protesters hid from police in side streets towards the end of the protest. “Shot six times,” people were heard saying.

The disclosure only looked likely to intensify the protests during their second week. “If they keep coming out here and doing this shit, then we’re gonna keep coming out here too,” said Smith. “They’re not gonna kill us off.”",589,2027,"Announcement follows most intense violence since shooting of Michael Brown, with police firing teargas hours before curfew",NA

A massive show of force by riot police and newly arrived national guard units failed to quell agitators who fired gunshots and threw Molotov cocktails on Monday night and early on Tuesday morning.

{Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.guprod.gnl/world/missouri""> national guard troops entered the protest zone and police ordered the media to leave as officers in armoured vehicles fired teargas and stun grenades and engaged with gunmen.

The mayhem dashed hopes that {the deployment of the national guard,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/what-is-national-guard-ferguson-missouri""> and greater community efforts to control the small minority of violent protesters, would ease a crisis which flared after a local police officer shot Michael Brown, 18, on 9 August.

At a 2.20am press conference, Captain Ron Johnson of the {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> state highway patrol said 31 people had been arrested, some who had come from as far afield as New York and California. He said two people were shot and displayed two handguns and a Molotov cocktail he said had been confiscated by police.

Johnson made an impassioned defence of the scale of the police response, which has come under sharp criticism. He said officers had acted with restraint against “criminal acts by a tiny minority of lawbreakers”.

Adding that police had at one point come under gunfire, and that several officers had been injured by rocks and bottles, Johnson urged peaceful protesters from now on to limit their demonstrations to daytime and not give cover to criminals at night.

“We’re going to make this neighbourhood whole, we’re going to make this community whole, and we’re going to do it together,” said Johnson, close to tears. “And I am not going to let criminals who come here from across the country or live in this community define this neighbourhood.”

Hours earlier {Barack Obama distanced himself from the decision to deploy the national guard.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/obama-attorney-general-eric-holder-ferguson""> He also dispatched the attorney general, Eric Holder, to monitor events and said he would be watching whether troops were “helping or hindering the situation”.

It is the first time the national guard has been deployed to quell civil unrest in the {United States}<hyperlink=""http://www.guprod.gnl/world/usa""> since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.

Monday’s protest remained peaceful until about 10pm. More than a thousand people, including dozens of Pentecostal ministers, marched without incident under the gaze of police with helmets and shields.

When rowdy youths threw bottles of water at police, volunteers formed a line and herded them back, away from police. They begged the officers to not intervene: “Relax, we’ve got this, give us a chance.”

Initially police made limited interventions: snatch squads bolted forwards to grab and haul away certain individuals, a new tactic in Ferguson.

But more serious trouble flared 500 metres away at the site of a burned convenience store where dozens of youths, some with covered faces, ripped up street signs and taunted police. Unidentified gunmen opened fire, triggering volleys of police stun grenades and teargas.

Provocateurs had again infiltrated a legitimate protest, Ron Conway, a highway patrol captain who commands policing in Ferguson, told CNN. “That element that has been causing havoc got within the peaceful protest.” Two people were shot and were taken to hospital, he said.

The fiercest clashes took place near the site where a police officer, Darren Wilson, shot Brown. Journalists were unable to monitor the scenes after being ordered to a command centre about a mile away. Several journalists were detained, apparently for unlawful assembly.

Conway defended the use of militarised force. “We can’t send officers in squad cars in areas where they’re shooting bullets. We have to send them in armoured cars.”

The Missouri governor, Jay Nixon, struggling to find an effective response to the protests that have rocked Ferguson since the shooting of Brown, has abandoned a controversial and ineffective curfew that failed to prevent violence.

Obama, speaking from the White House, called for a review of the use of military equipment by local police forces, warning that a continued blurring of the lines between military and local law enforcement would be “contrary to our traditions”.

He struck a more detached tone over the root causes of violence. He acknowledged the feelings of alienation felt by many young African Americans in the US: “In too many communities around this country young men of color are left behind and seen as objects of fear,” he said. But he also accused some protesters of “stirring chaos” and declined to answer whether he would be visiting the city himself.

“While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police, only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos,” said the president in a White House address that interrupted his two-week vacation. “It undermines rather than advanc[es] justice.”

Earlier on Monday, it was revealed that the White House had not been given advance warning of Nixon’s decision to call out the Missouri national guard, something Obama did not deny when asked about the deployment.

“I spoke to Jay Nixon about this, expressed an interest in making sure that if in fact the national guard is used, it is used in a limited and appropriate way,” said the president. “He described the support role that they are going to be providing to local law enforcement. And I’ll be watching over the next several days, to assess whether, in fact, it’s helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson.”

A heavy-handed police response in the first few days of demonstrations has been widely criticised in Washington, where some lawmakers are proposing legislation to limit a federal scheme that has been used to distribute surplus military equipment to civil police departments.

“I think it’s probably useful for us to review how the funding has gone, how local law enforcement has used grant dollars, to make sure that what they’re purchasing is stuff that they actually need,” said Obama. “Because, you know, there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don’t want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our traditions.”

But, other than announcing that Holder would be visiting Ferguson on Wednesday, there was little new intervention by the administration in the handling of the crisis.

Unlike his response to the shooting of the Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, Obama has been reluctant to take sides in the dispute over the police shooting of Michael Brown – perhaps wary of further polarising the national debate or appearing to condone the violent reaction.

“I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed,” said Obama.

Holder acknowledged the frustrations felt by protesters about the lack of information about the investigations. “I realise there is tremendous interest in the facts of the incident that led to Michael Brown’s death, but I ask for the public’s patience as we conduct this investigation,” Holder said in a statement after meeting Obama.

In Ferguson, attorneys for Brown’s family claimed that the {findings of a private autopsy indicated that he was killed while trying to surrender.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/michael-brown-autopsy-teenager-surrendering-ferguson"">

Brown was shot “at least” six times by officer Darren Wilson and was ultimately killed by a bullet that entered the top of his head and travelled “back to front”, attorney Daryl Parks said the autopsy had found, arguing this showed Brown was fatally shot when his head was well bowed.

Dr Michael Baden, who carried out the autopsy, said that “there weren’t signs of a struggle” on Brown’s body. Police have said that Brown assaulted Wilson after the officer stopped him and a friend and told them to walk on the sidewalk rather than in the road.

However Baden, the former chief medical examiner for New York City, was more cautious than the lawyers, stating that the findings in his preliminary report “could be consistent” with suggestions that Brown had been shot while charging at Wilson. “It’s possible,” he said.

“There are many different witness testimonies,” said Baden. “Many seem to line up in one direction, some in another direction. Right now until we get more information we can’t, from a forensic science point of view, distinguish and can’t make an absolute judgment.”",NA,1942,Another night of chaos 10 days after shooting of Michael Brown by police in Missouri dashes hopes of easing crisis,NA
Guardian,guard4,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/ferguson-outsiders-protesters-riots-peaceful-unrest,Ferguson: outsiders spread unrest and unease in pursuit of eclectic aims,Rory Carroll,08/19/14,03/23/16,"For more than a week the people of {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> welcomed the outside activists who flocked here to show solidarity after police killed an unarmed teenager. By day 11, some residents were having second thoughts.

The {intensified mayhem of recent nights,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/ferguson-police-national-guard-michael-brown-missouri-crisis""> apparently initiated by a small, organised group of agitators, has raised a question mark over the strangers who join the nightly demonstrations.

“Who the hell are you people?” one woman shouted early on Tuesday morning as youths surged towards a phalanx of police, hurling insults, water bottles and, later, molotov cocktails.

With the national guard deployed to quell civil unrest in the US {for the first time in over a decade,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/what-is-national-guard-ferguson-missouri""> amid a night of gunshots, teargas, chaos and 31 arrests, it was an urgent question.

Volunteers – locals and outsiders – had for a time {kept a fragile peace}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/obama-attorney-general-eric-holder-ferguson""> by linking arms and forcing rowdy youths, many covering their faces with masks and bandannas, {back from lines of police with riot gear}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/aug/19/protests-michael-brown-killing-ferguson-missouri-in-pictures""> and armoured vehicles.

“Relax. If we relax, they relax,” said one man with a megaphone. For a time it worked, and it seemed Ferguson could break the cycle of violent confrontation.

Then, about 500 metres down the other end of the avenue, in front of the ruins of a destroyed QuikTrip store that has been a focus of the protests here, a small group of youths tore up street signs and threw bottles at police. Then at least one of them opened fire, triggering a heavy police response of stun grenades and teargas which made the town, yet again, resemble a war zone.

“If you don’t live here you don’t worry about the burning and looting,” said Steve Beale, 27, who works at an electrical goods store. “You don’t worry about stores closing, or losing your job, or walking for miles to buy food. Well, I live here and I do worry.”

Many other residents voiced the same belief that most, though not all, of the looters, shooters and molotov cocktail throwers were outsiders. “I appreciate seeing people coming here to support us,” said T’erell Wilhite, 18, a student who lives close to where a police officer gunned down Michael Brown on 9 August, triggering the protests.

“But some of them are violent. I’m wondering if the negative outweighs the positive. The focus should be on the family and their loss. The rowdiness should stop.”

There is no easy way to confirm the identities of the hard core rioters. They tend to cover their faces and not give interviews while hurling projectiles or fleeing teargas.

But the perception that they are among the visitors has shifted some scrutiny from police to the eclectic clusters of civil rights activists, anarchists, nihilists, socialists, hipsters, artists, Muslims, Christians and Buddhists.

Antonio French, a local alderman who has joined the nightly marches, warned of a new dynamic after Sunday night’s chaos. “There is a small group of people who cannot be defined as protestors/demonstrators. They are more like fighters/rebels/insurgents,” he {tweeted.}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench/statuses/501355348356521987"">

The concern has given a twist to the criticism that this St Louis suburb, whose population is two-thirds black, is at the mercy of authorities who do not reflect or understand it.

Fifty of the Ferguson police department’s 53 officers are white, {including Darren Wilson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-darren-wilson-account-michael-brown-shooting""> who {shot Brown six times.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/michael-brown-autopsy-teenager-surrendering-ferguson""> Most of the reinforcements from the highway patrol, St Louis County police and National Guard, which arrived on Monday, are also outsiders.

Sonny Dayan, 53, the owner of a store at the heart of the riot zone, blamed police and rioters for his boarded-up windows and absent customers. He suspected local criminals were helping drive the violence. “Guys on drugs, the rapper attitude, nothing political about it for them.” But most rioters, Dayan felt, were outsiders with their own agenda.

Teresa Mithen Danieley, the rector of St John’s episcopal church, said looters and firebombers were distracting from the tragedy which triggered the crisis. “It’s really pathetic. People should not be taking advantage of the violent death of a child. There is a difference between being an activist and being foolish. An activist has discipline, goals and strategy.”

Others have generated a colourful and at times carnival-type atmosphere. A man who called himself Django, after the Quentin Tarantino movie, trotted a horse down West Florissant Avenue. There have been Buddhist monks in orange robes, Muslims in purple tunics, evangelical Christians with megaphones quoting Deuteronomy, and Socialist Worker Party activists advocating capitalism’s overthrow.

Some, like a young white Californian who gave his name only as Sam, are drifters with no clear-cut agenda. “I’m an anarchist and I was in the region so I decided to come. What’s happening here is inspirational, people are resisting,” said Sam, who has slept out some nights.

His T-shirt, with “inshallah” written in English and Arabic, drew the attention of a police officer who smiled at demonstrators and said he was praying for them. “You with the Muslim shirt, I’m praying for you too.”

Despite the suspicion over provocateurs many residents continued to express gratitude for their guests, invited or otherwise. “Strength in numbers”, said Gino Addison, 36, whose porch overlooks the site where Brown was killed. “We can’t make this much noise without all this support.

Ferguson is the site of an occupation happening in plain sight, and the police remain undeterred because they can occupy, because they know they have unlimited power, because they know they cannot be stopped.

I am stunned but I should not be. I recognize the luxury of my disbelief. I will never allow myself such luxury again. Today, I truly understand privilege.

I am outraged but I do not know what to do with my outrage that might be productive, that might move this world forward toward a place where black lives matter, and where black parents no longer need to {have “the talk” with their children}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/mike-brown-ferguson-shooting-police-black""> about how not to be killed by police and where anger over a lifetime of wrongs is not judged, but understood and supported.

The mainstream media is trying to report on this travesty, and all too often, they are failing. There is a preoccupation with the actions of a few, with the salacious discussions of looting and a people run amok over the plight of the many living in an occupied community.

In truth, the media rarely seems well equipped to write about tragedy and trauma ethically, particularly when race is involved. It does not know how to report on Ferguson’s grief and anger without resorting to the most facile – and often most damaging – language that only perpetuates the ever-present racial divide in this country. A {USA Today headline read,}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/dhh/statuses/499955910954196992""> “Police seek order as Ferguson furor builds”, seemingly without irony because, just above that headline, is a picture of peaceful protestors and, above that, {the alarming statistics from the Ferguson police blotter}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/blacks-overwhelmingly-get-stopped-by-the-police-in-ferguson#.dhgLDy7AXL""> that reveal how the black citizens of that town, are indeed persecuted. The disconnect is hiding in plain sight.

But the media is comprised of people, and those people have been acculturated in a country that does not value black lives or the tenor of black anger and grief. This is a culture that does not care about black anger and grief unless it inconveniences them.

Those in the media are no better equipped than anyone else to overcome profound cultural biases. The police in Ferguson are clearly not equipped to overcome these biases despite {some of the best military-grade hardware our federal tax dollars could buy.}<hyperlink=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/ferguson-missouri-militarized-police-1033-program""> Politicians who have remained largely silent or diffident on the situation are no better equipped to overcome these biases. Our own president, Barack Obama, {offered nothing but a lukewarm statement on Thursday,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/obama-ferguson-police-excessive-force-michael-brown""> calling for peace and calm, and for a thorough investigation. But we need so much more; we are so far past peace and calm.

Perhaps, as the president said, it is best for us to look forward, to look beyond the spent teargas canisters on American streets and the images of a community, protesting peacefully, their hands high in the air so they might not be murdered.

But how, then, is change possible? 

Those of us who are watching at a remove are trying to find the words to describe our horror, our dismay, our anger but nothing seems adequate. We are not there. Our good intentions on social networks won’t change the situation. Our pithy comments about how we are now, finally, like the rest of the world won’t change the situation.

We need action from our political leaders. We need change in how the police protect and serve. We need to redefine how the law regards black people. As individuals, we need to fundamentally alter how we think about race in America. We need to do the hard work of overcoming our lesser selves.

Guardian,guard6,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/19/guardian-view-on-ferguson-riots,The Guardian view on the Ferguson riots,Editorial,08/19/14,03/23/16,"Every night in Ferguson, Missouri, a new policing tactic. Every night, a fresh ratcheting of tension. It is 11 days now since police in Ferguson shot dead an unarmed African American teenager, Michael Brown. Since then, the authorities have veered from one public-order tactic to another, so far without success. They have swamped the streets with military vehicles, then removed them, imposed a curfew, then lifted it, fired teargas and stun grenades, then shelved their weapons before using them again. They have passed the problem from the Ferguson police to the Missouri highway patrol, and then to national guard troops. The arrival of these last on Monday night had little immediate impact; {78 more arrests,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/ferguson-call-quiet-78-arrests-protests-clashes""> amid allegations that outside militants are involved and with police coming under fire. Yesterday, a {further fatal shooting by police of a black man in St Louis}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/police-officer-shooting-st-louis-dead-knife""> underscored that things may get worse before they get better.

Always in such situations, people ask: why here and why now? The answers are rarely entirely sufficient. As so often, the immediate cause of the conflict was local outrage against the police killing of a young and unarmed African American. In this sense, Brown is simply the latest on a long list of victims, like Eric Garner, who died in New York last month after police got him in a chokehold, or Trayvon Martin, who was shot dead in Florida by a neighbourhood-watch vigilante in 2012, back to the police shooting of 15-year-old James Powell in Harlem 50 years ago this summer, a killing that triggered a week of rioting. Such things do not happen, by and large, to unarmed young white men. {Public attitudes to such events polarise along racial lines, as has happened at Ferguson.}<hyperlink=""http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/"">

The continuity of race was a fundamental factor in the killing, the rioting and the response, yet plenty has changed for black people in America since 1964. After all, the Missouri highway patrol commander who was brought in by the governor to take charge after the initial official hamfistedness in Ferguson is a black man. So is the US attorney general who brought the FBI into the case just two days after the shooting and who is due in Ferguson today. The president of the United States, who spoke once again for his nation this week as the violence continued, is a black man too. These things embody a major black advance into the middle class in the wake of the civil rights movement. All the same, millions of other African Americans remained left behind in places like {Ferguson.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson"">

Yet Brown was killed in Ferguson, not somewhere else. St Louis and its suburbs such as Ferguson, large communities in historic slave states of the US, were places of racial segregation for many decades. Today, Ferguson is a 67% black community in a regional economy badly hit by recession. Yet its police force is 95% white and relies heavily on its revenue from stopping cars for speeding and other infringements. In Ferguson last year, 86% of stops, 92% of searches and 93% of arrests were of black people. None of this made it inevitable that the latest controversial racial killing would happen in Ferguson rather than elsewhere, or that Ferguson’s police would then respond so particularly foolishly, or that these events would spiral into a signature confrontation, bringing visiting national guard, {outside troublemakers,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/ferguson-outsiders-protesters-riots-peaceful-unrest""> journalists and pundits ({some of them badly treated too}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-police-arrest-photographer-scott-olsen"">) to St Louis, and even getting the attention of the UN secretary general. But none of it helped either. There seems very little doubt that the authorities in Ferguson have exacerbated violent tensions that could have been calmed.

Riots are always easier to explain in general terms than to pin down in particular ones. Perhaps the only three things that can be said with total confidence about events in Ferguson are: one, that they are not over yet; two, that they will nevertheless end eventually; and three, that they will rightly generate much heart-searching in an America where racial injustice, even now and in spite of all the progress, remains the great enduring national wound.",143,534,"Another tragic and unjust killing of a young black man shows that, for all the progress on civil rights, America’s racial wounds are still open",NA
Guardian,guard7,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/ferguson-police-michael-brown-protesters,Ferguson police clash with Michael Brown protesters again overnight,Jon Swaine; Rory Carroll,08/16/14,03/25/16,"Police in riot gear clashed overnight with small groups of protesters in Ferguson, Missouri amid signs of renewed tensions over the shooting of an unarmed teenager by a local patrol officer.

The flareups, breaking a period of relative calm, came after police released surveillance footage that implicated Michael Brown, 18, in the theft of a packet of cigars from a convenience store a few minutes before he was shot. Brown's family condemned the revelation as a ""character assassination"" designed to smear the teenager and divert attention from the actions of police.

One of the flashpoints in the early hours of Saturday came at the store where the robbery was alleged to have taken place. Police fired a teargas canister at a crowd of around 200 people who had gathered there. Some protesters threw bottles at officers in riot gear and shouted ""hands up, don't shoot"", the chant that has come to characterise the protests. According to some accounts, Brown had his hands up when he was shot.

A small crowd later looted the convenience store. A meat market was also looted and other businesses had windows smashed. Police did not intervene.

Other demonstrators and community leaders pleaded with the looters to stop. Claire McCaskill, Missouri's senior US senator, asked outside observers to recognise that the looters represented only a fraction of the protests.

""America, please don't hold small group of looters against hundreds & hundreds of peaceful protesters. Rather hold small group accountable,"" {she said on Twitter.}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/clairecmc/status/500625147016265728"">

Governor Jay Nixon was scheduled to meet local leaders on Saturday afternoon, to discuss what his office called ""actions to ensure public safety and civil rights"". Nixon {said earlier on Twitter}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/GovJayNixon/status/500643952425308163"">: ""Long night. Thanks to all who tried to stop unnecessary violence""

By Saturday morning the area was calm and largely deserted save for some store owners who braved grey, driving rain – a contrast after a hot, dry week – to guard their stores.

Ferguson police simultaneously released the surveillance footage, a report into the robbery, and {named of the police officer who shot Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/ferguson-police-darren-wilson-michael-brown-shooting""> as a six-year veteran of the city police department, Darren Wilson. Stoking the tensions, police gave conflicting accounts of whether the events were linked.

Early on Friday, Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson indicated that the officer stopped Brown in response to a callout over police radio describing the suspect for the robbery. Yet at a second press conference in the afternoon, Jackson said that the ""initial contact was not related to the robbery"". Brown was stopped because he was walking down the middle of the street, obstructing traffic, the police chief said.

Later still, Jackson was {quoted by the St Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-officer-realized-during-encounter-that-michael-brown-might-be/article_52c40b84-ad90-5f9a-973c-70d628d0be04.html""> as saying that Wilson saw cigars in Brown's hand and realised that he might be a suspect in the robbery.

Attorneys for the Browns said that the family were ""beyond outraged"" at the simultaneous release, describing it as a strategic move to smear their son.

""There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution-style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender,"" the lawyers said in a joint statement.

The FBI, which is investigating whether the shooting breached amounted to a civil rights violation, announced late on Friday that agents would be ""canvassing the neighbourhood"" over the next few days to find new witnesses.

Jackson said the police report was released in response to freedom of information requests by media outlets, apparently following tip-offs. Such requests can often take weeks or months to be fulfilled.

However, commenting on the resurgence of police clashes with protesters, Captain Ron Johnson, of the Missouri highway patrol, which was handed responsibility for policing the protests on Thursday, admitted he was worried that the release of the information would cause renewed tensions. ""We had concerns that this would happen,"" he said. ""I will say we talked all day about the release of the video tape at the food mart.""

Johnson, who won plaudits for his handling of the demonstrations after being handed control on Thursday, said he ""would have liked to have been consulted"" about the simultaneous release of the report of the name and alleged robbery.

""The information could have been put out in a different way,"" Johnson told reporters and residents at a press conference that unfolded more like a town hall meeting on Friday. ""I would have communicated it differently,"" he told the Guardian afterwards. No details were released about the shooting of Brown, despite that being the subject of similar freedom of information requests.

The disagreement over Friday's decision highlighted the overlapping jurisdictions of the law enforcement agencies involved. The robbery report was released by Ferguson city police, the force that employs Wilson, which has come under sharp criticism for not reflecting the racial makeup of the city, which is majority African American.

The inquiry into the shooting is being led by St Louis County police, which led the policing of the demonstrations over Brown's death through {several nights of violent clashes,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-teargas-rubber-bullets-michael-brown""> before being relieved by Missouri governor Jay Nixon on Thursday.

Adding further tension between the various authorities involved, county prosecutor Bob McCulloch, who would be responsible for bringing any charges against the officer, reportedly reacted furiously to Nixon's transfer of the policing of the demonstrations. ""It's shameful, what he did,"" McCulloch {told the St Louis Post-Dispatch.}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/gov-nixon-gives-police-control-of-ferguson-situation-to-missouri/article_0806541b-ed48-5d06-9267-323531ad6cf1.html"">

St Louis County police have a warrant for computer hard drives and video from the convenience store involved in the robbery.

More than a dozen officers, including Johnson, the highway patrol captain, visited the store on Friday afternoon and talked with staff.

At the store, customers defended the owner.""They're good people. I've known them for over 10 years,"" said Eugene Ward. ""If the evidence shows that the gentleman was here and committed a crime that doesn't change the excessive police reaction. But it also doesn't condone what the young man did.""",879,466,Police fire teargas at crowd of around 200 gathered near shop Michael Brown was suspected of robbing ,NA

Marginalised by the city’s establishment, he could feel that non-violence both as a strategy and as a principle was eroding among his supporters. “I need some help in getting this method across,” he said. “A lot of people have lost faith in the establishment … They’ve lost faith in the democratic process. They’ve lost faith in non-violence … [T]hose who make this peaceful revolution impossible will make a violent revolution inevitable, and we’ve got to get this over, I need help.

As the {situation escalates}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-michael-brown-shot-multiple-times-autopsy-shows-including-in-head""> in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, where police recently shot an unarmed black man as he walked down the street, many are clearly losing faith. As {the first day of curfew}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/opinion/in-ferguson-black-town-white-power.html?_r=0""> drew to a close, hundreds of police in riot gear swept through the streets, using tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets against an increasingly agitated crowd. Earlier this morning the governor, Jay Nixon, {deployed the national guard.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-missouri-protests.html"">

Protesters insist the police action was unprovoked. Police say it followed shootings, firebombs, looting and, crucially, an attempted attack on the area they are using as a command centre. Ronald Johnson, the {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> highway patrol captain drafted by the governor to take over security in the town and calm the situation down, blamed “premeditated criminal acts”. Late last week, Johnson was the darling of the crowds as he expressed sympathy with their cause and frustration with the tactics of the local police department. Now the situation seems polarised once again.

Johnson said the attacks were clearly provocations against the police. “We had to act to protect lives and property,” he says. In a statement explaining his deployment of the national guard, the governor, Jay Nixon, blamed “deliberate, coordinated and intensifying violent acts”.

“Tonight,” he said. “A day of hope, prayers and peaceful protests was marred by the violent criminal acts of an organised and growing number of individuals, many from outside the community and state, whose actions are putting the residents and businesses of {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> at risk.”

Such statements ignore the nature, scale and source of the problem. When an 18-year-old is shot in daylight for walking down the middle of the street holding his arms up; and when his shooter is whisked out of town by the state, then the residents of Ferguson {were clearly already “at risk”}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/15/michael-brown-ferguson-america-racism""> from those who would commit “premeditated criminal acts”. What could be more “deliberate” and “coordinated” than releasing a video that claims to be of Michael Brown stealing cigarillos the same day the police finally release the name of the policeman who shot him, when {the alleged theft}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/darren-wilson-identified-killed-18-year-old-michael-brown-article-1.1904539""> had nothing to do with the shooting. (Even if it had, since when has the charge for shoplifting been summary execution?)

According to a {preliminary autopsy,}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html""> Brown was shot six times including twice in the head. Dr Michael Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, who performed the autopsy at the request of the family, said: “In my capacity as the forensic examiner for the New York State Police, I would say, ‘You’re not supposed to shoot so many times.’ Right now there is too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.”

For some then the police have come too late to the notion that they are there to “protect” lives. “The law,” wrote James Baldwin, “is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer.” Those who call for law and order now must understand that there is no order because men with badges have been acting lawlessly.

As I wrote {after the riots}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/14/young-british-rioters-political-actions""> in London three years ago: “Insisting on the criminality of those involved, as though that alone explains their motivations and the context is irrelevant, is fatuous. To stress criminality does not deny the political nature of what took place, it simply chooses to only partially describe it. They were looting, not shoplifting, and challenging the police for control of the streets, not stealing [policemen’s] hubcaps. When a group of people join forces to flout both law and social convention, they are acting politically.”

For good reason, the nature of such rebellions troubles many. They attract opportunists, macho-men and thrill-seekers as well as the righteously indignant and politically militant. Resistance to occupation is often romanticised but never pretty. And Ferguson – a mostly black town under curfew in which the {entire political power structure}<hyperlink=""http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-81054012/""> is white, with a militarised police force that killed a black child – was {under occupation.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/opinion/in-ferguson-black-town-white-power.html"">

Riots are also polarising. They narrow the base of support for campaigns, sending potential sympathisers into the arms of the state, demanding a police crackdown. People ask: what could violent protest possibly achieve? It is a good question. But it only has any validity if they also question {the nature of the “peace”}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/14/open-season-black-boys-verdict""> preceding it. Those who call for calm must question how calm anyone can be in the knowledge that their son, brother or lover could be shot in such a way.

People have a right to resist occupation, even if we don’t necessarily agree with every method they use to do so.

As I also wrote, {following the British disturbances}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/05/reasons-riot-uk-protest-study"">: “One should not overstate the case: [throwing firebombs and shooting at police] are not the hallmarks of political sophistication. But then nor are riots. They are the crudest tool for those who have few options. By definition, they are chaotic. Rich people don’t riot because they have other forms of influence. {Riots are a class act.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/nov/14/france.eu"">”

Nobody in their right mind wants more violent protests. But nobody wants more Michael Browns either. And those two things – the violence of the state and the violence of the street – are connected. “A riot,” said Martin Luther King, “is the language of the unheard.” The people on the streets don’t donate thousands of dollars to anyone’s campaign. They don’t get a seat at any table where decisions are made or have the ear of the powerful. But with four black men killed by the police in the country in the last four weeks, they have a lot to say, and precious few avenues through which to say it.

The Guardian’s Jon Swaine witnessed the arrest of two reporters.

Jon writes:

The two reporters were taken in cuffs from a McDonald’s in downtown Ferguson and placed in an unmarked white police van.

“They’re reporters,” shouted one member of the public, who had also been in the restaurant. Another customer confirmed seeing the pair at work inside. Lowery and Reilly both tweeted about being asked to leave the restaurant moments before they were seen being arrested.

Asked why he was being detained, the first reporter shouted: “For videotaping them.” When I approached a police line in an effort to confirm the reporters’ identities, I was threatened with arrest and told to retreat.

The arrests came as a line of police in riot gear swept eastward along West Florissant street, the main drag in downtown Ferguson where demonstrations have flared for the past three nights. Residents were forced out of the street as they tried to return to their homes.

“I forgot the Pampers for my two-year-old son,” said Whitt, who lives yards from where Michael Brown was shot dead last Saturday. “I had to take back some groceries, cos we needed a couple of extra dollars. We’re broke people.”

As Whitt, 34, pedalled back to the store with his receipt, he sensed a car approaching from behind and heard a crushingly familiar sound. “He put the siren on,” said Whitt. “Whoop, whoop!”

A cop asked him what Whitt was doing in the area. He wanted to see his identification, and rifled through his shopping bag to see what he was carrying. Then, he ran Whitt’s name in search of outstanding warrants.

“I told him ‘that’s illegal, you’re violating my rights’,” said Whitt. “‘I have not broken the law. You ain’t got probable cause for nothing’. He told me ‘I can cite you for not wearing a helmet’.”

Whitt was eventually freed to go. But he was left incensed. “I wanted to shoot that motherfucker,” he said this week. “I wanted to. Because he had no right to bother me.”

The raw fury in this northern suburb of St Louis over the killing of Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old apparently walking back from a convenience store, may slowly fade in the coming weeks and months.

But the underlying, bitter resentment among many in the local African American community about their treatment at the hands of an almost unanimously white police force and local authorities, will likely continue to simmer.

Ferguson’s population is 67% black, but 50 of Jackson’s 53 police officers – 94% – are white. Figures {published last year by Missouri’s attorney general}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf""> showed seven black drivers were stopped by police for every white driver, and that 12 times as many searches were carried out on black drivers as white. The sharp disparities fuel mistrust, residents said.

‘A subculture of prejudice’
Asked about race relations at a press conference on Wednesday, Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson acknowledged that there was a “community that is at odds with us now”. He said: “Apparently there has been this undertow that has now bubbled to the surface.”

Addressing a town hall meeting in Ferguson earlier this week, Cornell Brooks, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said that police in the city must address a “subculture” of prejudice. “Sometimes that means putting more people in uniform that look like me,” he said.

“I’ve been trying to increase the diversity of the department since I got here,” Jackson insisted on Wednesday, pointing out that he had promoted black officers and describing his pursuit of diversity as a “constant struggle”.

Still, one after another, young black residents complained to the Guardian about the way they have been treated by those in positions of power in the city over recent years. Their claims against police officers in particular ranged from disrespect to “all-out race war”.

The city authorities are led by a white mayor, James Knowles. Four out of the five {city councillors with profiles on the city website}<hyperlink=""http://www.fergusoncity.com/171/Council-Members""> are white; one is black. The setup is largely a relic of an era less than two decades old, when Ferguson had a majority-white population. Then came steady de-industrialisation and the so-called “white flight” to suburbs further afield, with many of the families that left said to have done so primarily to avoid the integration of the city’s schools system.

Several people pointed to Art McCoy, who was appointed the superintendent of that struggling school system in 2011, as a rare example of a black man in a position of authority in the city. They said McCoy was well-respected among residents and understood students. Only 35% of students in the district pass maths tests used by the state to assess schools. 41% pass the English test.

However in November last year, McCoy was pushed out of his job and placed on administrative leave, for reasons that remain unclear. Hundreds of students staged protests against the decision, and parents inundated city authorities with complaints. McCoy was replaced by {Larry Larrew, the acting superintendent,}<hyperlink=""http://www.fergflor.org/pages/Ferguson-Florissant_SD/About_Us/Administration""> who is white.

Patricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman for the city, said that an unusually high number of municipalities and legislative bodies in the region had created a cascading system of authorities that appeared disconnected from the lives of many African American families.

“Black people see all these layers of white authority that do not like them, do not understand them and do not respect them,” said Bynes, who is black. “When the traffic court is in session here you will have a white judge, a white prosecutor and a line of black people waiting to pay penalties wrapping around the block. It breeds resentment and anger about their taxes.”

Bynes conceded that the failure of black residents to vote in local elections had perpetuated the problem. But, she said, “many are disenfranchised because they don’t vote and they don’t show up because they are too busy working out how they are going to eat and feed their families the next day.” About 22% of Missouri’s residents live below the federal poverty line.

Jackson stressed on Wednesday that “race relations are a top priority right now”. He said officials from the department of justice would be assisting Ferguson with officer training and helping the force to “fix what’s wrong”.

But as protesters began a standoff on Tuesday night with a long line of police blocking downtown Ferguson, decked out in riot gear and backed by two armoured vehicles, many said that they weren’t interested in a dialogue.

A few even said that Sunday’s looting and torching of a QuikTrip gas station near the scene of Brown’s killing should be interpreted as an attack on all outsider-owned businesses, which would continue.

“We can use this as an opportunity,” one man, Charles Jolley, told a few dozen allies whose attention he held, several of whom agreed vocally. “We can reclaim our community. This is a war, and we are soldiers on the front line”.",507,2307,"Raw fury over Brown’s killing may slowly fade, but the underlying resentment among Ferguson’s young black residents about their treatment by a white police force will likely continue to simmer",NA
Guardian,guard11,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/police-officer-shooting-st-louis-dead-knife,Second fatal St Louis area shooting stokes tensions in Ferguson,Chris McGreal; Rory Carroll,08/19/14,03/25/16,"Racial tensions in Missouri were stoked again on Tuesday when police killed another African American man as authorities struggled to quell the nightly confrontations over the shooting of an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> last week.

Angry residents of a black neighbourhood in St Louis, not far from Ferguson, accused the police of excessive force after two officers fired several bullets into a 23-year-old man described as carrying a knife and behaving erratically. The man has not yet been named but he was well known in the area and was said to have learning difficulties.

Sam Dotson, the chief of St Louis’s metropolitan police, said the man did not obey orders to drop a knife and was within four feet of the officers when they shot him. The dead man was later named locally as Kajieme Powell.

Authorities in Ferguson had earlier issued a plea for “night-time quiet and reconciliation” on Tuesday after another night of gunfire, teargas and chaos 10 days after the shooting of Brown in circumstances that remain disputed.

Jail records {obtained by local media outlets}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/78-arrested-overnight-most-missouri-arrest-records-show-n184036""> revealed that 78 people were arrested in clashes with protesters on Sunday night and Monday morning, despite a {massive show of force}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/ferguson-call-quiet-78-arrests-protests-clashes""> by riot police and newly arrived national guard units. Officials had earlier put the number of people detained at 31. A spokeswoman for St Louis County said on Tuesday that 57 had been booked at the county jail, and that more may have been detained elsewhere.

Brown’s parents, appearing on the Today show on NBC, said they believed the unrest would be alleviated if Darren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed their son {was prosecuted.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/michael-brown-parents-ferguson-justice-peace""> “Justice will bring peace I believe,” Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s mother, told the Today show’s Matt Lauer. “Him being arrested, charges being filed and a prosecution. Him being held accountable for what he did.”

A grand jury will likely begin hearing evidence from witnesses to the shooting. Ed Magee, a spokesman for the St Louis County prosecuting attorney, Bob McCulloch, who is overseeing the case, said his office would try to start presenting evidence on Wednesday during the regular once-a-week meeting date for the grand jury.

Wilson, who is represented by St Louis attorney Greg Kloeppel, has provided the St Louis County Police with an account of the controversial 9 August shooting, according to Magee.

Members of the grand jury will meet to determine if the evidence collected against Wilson warrants criminal charges. The process is not adversarial – attorneys for Wilson will not be allowed to join proceedings.

McCulloch’s impartiality has come under fire from some local politicians, including outgoing St Louis county executive Charlie Dooley. Dooley has called for McCulloch to be replaced by a special prosecutor, citing concerns in the black community.

Brown’s family {announced}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/michael-brown-parents-ferguson-justice-peace""> that his funeral would be held on Monday, after federal authorities concluded a third autopsy on his body.

In Ferguson, leaders of the overwhelmingly white city administration urged peopled to stay at home to “allow peace to settle in” and pledged to reconnect with the predominantly black community. According to a statement, officials have been exploring how to increase the number of African American applicants to the law enforcement academy and raise funds for cameras that would be attached to patrol car dashboards and officers’ vests. “We plan to learn from this tragedy,” the leaders said in the statement.

The death of Brown has stoked 10 days of unrest in Ferguson and the surrounding area. The latest police killing took place a few miles away in a predominantly black neighbourhood.

Doris Davis, who saw the shooting from an upstairs window in her house, said she looked out when she heard the man shouting. “He said: No, no, no. Then they shot him from the front,” she told the Guardian. Davis, 66, said she saw two policemen open fire together and shoot several bullets each in rapid succession.

“I think it was excessive. People said he had a knife but if he had a knife they could have shot him in the foot. Or tasered him. They didn’t have to kill him,” she said. “I couldn’t believe my eyes, I have seen anything like that. I’ve never seen anyone get shot.”

Doton, the police chief, said witnesses could hear the man saying “Shoot me now, kill me now.”

Rauf Muhammad, a retired building contractor, who joined dozens of people protesting at the spot where the man was killed, said the victim had been attending the nightly protests against the killing of Brown in Ferguson. “Now it’s come to my neighbourhood,” he said. “People are fed up with getting this kind of treatment only because of the pigment of our skin. Do you think they would kill a white person like this? It could have been handled with a taser or a nightstick. They could have shot him in the leg. Crippled him. He’s going to fall.”

Dotson angered people further by saying: “I think officer safety is the number one issue.”

Several of the protestors angrily denounced that view. One young woman shouted: “Why are the lives of cops more important than anyone else?”

Dotson said the man has stolen two drinks from a convenience store and that the police responded to a 911 call. A view took hold among some of the people protesting outside the convenience store that the call was made by the owner. He denied it but would not discuss what happened further. But the mood was souring outside the shop, with some protestors making threats to destroy the property.

Davis’s daughter arrived to take her mother to another part of town, saying she feared there would be a violent reaction to the shooting.

“It’s very, very scary,” said Davis. “I’m afraid there’s going to be retaliation for this and I don’t know what people are going to do.”",NA,3765,"Police chief says suspect brandished a knife at officers after incident at convenience store, as crowd takes up refrain from nearby protests",NA

About 200 demonstrators ignored an order to return home at midnight made under a {state of emergency declared earlier on Saturday by the state’s governor, Jay Nixon,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/missouri-governor-curfew-state-of-emergency-ferguson""> after rioting and looting returned to the centre of the city on Friday night.

Seven people were arrested for failing to disperse, according to Captain Ron Johnson of the state highway patrol, who had earlier promised that the curfew would not be enforced by teargas. One man was shot and is in a critical condition, and a police car was shot at.

Several protesters smashed kerb stones to throw at police, while others threw stones and shouted abuse at a wall of advancing officers. One man threw a Molotov cocktail at a boarded-up Asian restaurant. Other protesters quickly extinguished the flames. “I was disappointed in the actions of tonight,” said Johnson.

Protesters chanted “no justice, no curfew” and “we are Mike Brown” as they gathered at midnight at one end of the street where unrest has centred. Dozens of officers, some carrying assault rifles, were still poised at the other end more than half an hour after the curfew began.

“I’m here for my people,” said a 25-year-old who would only give his initials as AA. “A man was shot down wrongfully. Why hasn’t the officer been charged? He hasn’t even been charged and you want people to leave the street? What about this child being dead?”

After 40 minutes, the police issued repeated warnings over a loudspeaker. “You are violating the state-imposed curfew,” they said. “You must clear the roadway and disperse peacefully. Failure to comply may result in arrest and/or other actions.” Many responded with yelled obscenities.

Eight minutes later, police began firing smoke and gas canisters, sending people running in all directions. One man fell to the ground, apparently incapacitated. Johnson later said that teargas was fired only because police received intelligence that people with guns were on the roof of a barbecue restaurant, awaiting officers.

One man was shot outside the restaurant and was rushed from the area in the back seat of a car. Johnson said his injuries were critical and it was unclear who had shot him. Several shots were fired, some apparently at a police car responding to reports of the injury.

The shooting prompted most remaining protesters to scatter. Soon after 1am, West Florissant Avenue, the main drag where clashes have raged, was cleared. But several pledged to return on Sunday. “We’re gonna be here every night,” said Jason Ross, 25, who was limping and said he had been burned on his ankle by part of a gas canister. “We’re staying here for justice.”

Earlier, as the clock ticked towards the midnight curfew, hundreds more people had gathered in the street. Some drove through in cars with music blaring, and passengers sitting on the roof or hanging out of windows.

Police started filing in more than two hours before midnight, lining the street and guarding store fronts from potential looters. Several people verbally abused them as they passed.

Heavy rain, thunder and lightning occasionally flashing on the horizon appeared to do little to persuade the mainly young and African American crowd to return to their homes. Few present expressed confidence that the street would empty by midnight.

“They’re letting this all build up,” said Jamal Harris, 23. “They could be out here gradually correcting things, mingling with us. But people are drinking, smoking and getting fired up. It could go down again.”

Observers from Amnesty International, which earlier on Saturday condemned curfews as the tool of dictators, were monitoring the street in bright yellow shirts. Activists from the Black Panthers, Nation of Islam and Christian groups urged people to go home by 11.30pm.

The five-hour curfew marked {another shift in law enforcement tactics,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/17/ron-johnson-ferguson-cop-middle-road-critics""> which have veered from militarised to conciliatory, in an effort to contain protests over the killing of Brown. Calm appeared to have been restored on Thursday after Johnson implemented a hands-off approach.

However Nixon, a Democrat, said the curfew was necessary after a small group of looters smashed windows, lobbed bottles and ransacked three stores {on Friday night.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/ferguson-police-michael-brown-protesters""> The fresh unrest followed the release by Ferguson police of a report detailing that Brown allegedly shoplifted from a convenience store minutes before his death.

The report, along with stills from surveillance footage, were released simultaneously with the name of the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson, prompting lawyers for the Brown family to accuse the police of a strategic “character assassination” to smear their late son.

Looters ransacked the shop from which Brown allegedly stole. Nixon said they sabotaged not just property but the community’s peaceful protests. “We must have – and maintain – peace,” he said. “The eyes of the world are watching.”

But law enforcement today too often violates the civil liberties of those they are sworn to protect, and the {increasing militarization of American law enforcement}<hyperlink=""http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Warrior-Cop-Militarization-Americas/dp/1610392116""> (an offshoot of the Wars on (Some) Drugs and Terror) is poisoning the trust of many citizens. (For others, particularly in minority communities who have borne the brunt of the “broken windows” model, that trust died long ago.).

Video and pictures are an equalizer: they’re not the only ones, and most of the power remains with the state, but they can be essential tools to help restore some balance in a system that, in recent years, has tilted in favor of those who interpret “protect and serve” as license to act with impunity. Among other uses, documentation and dissemination is helping professional and citizen journalists alike bring more clarity to events like those in Ferguson, via {“crowd-powered” coverage.}<hyperlink=""https://gigaom.com/2014/08/14/crowd-powered-journalism-becomes-crucial-when-traditional-media-is-unwilling-or-unable/"">

The response of some in American law enforcement to the increasing prevelance of cameras has been to conduct a flagrantly unconstitutional {“war on photography”}<hyperlink=""https://photographyisnotacrime.com""> aimed, in so many cases, at preventing citizens from holding them accountable for their actions. But the First Amendment still means something: in a series of rulings, including {this one,}<hyperlink=""http://www.dmlp.org/blog/2011/victory-recording-public""> federal and state judges have affirmed the public’s right to capture photos and videos of police in public spaces, as long as they are not directly interfering. A number of organizations, including the {ACLU}<hyperlink=""http://www.aclupa.org/issues/policepractices/your-right-record-and-observe-police/taking-photos-video-and-audio/""> and the conservative {Heritage Foundation,}<hyperlink=""http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/06/filming-the-watchmen-why-the-first-amendment-protects-your-right-to-film-the-police-in-public-places""> offer guides for people who want to exercise their rights to document the actions of law enforcement officers, and the Justice Department has made it clear that {the right to record the police is settled law.}<hyperlink=""http://static.photographyisnotacrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/USDOJ-on-recording-cops.pdf"">

Nonetheless, some law enforcement officers will not take kindly to your exercising those rights. There are risks, as Antonio French and other people have discovered – and those risks are greater for people who lack power.

It’s possible that law enforcement officials could go beyond targeting camera-wielding civilians for searches, deletion demands and arrest. Mobile phone towers {have already been disabled to thwart protests,}<hyperlink=""http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/BART-admits-halting-cell-service-to-stop-protests-2335114.php""> for example, and governments elsewhere in world have shut down access to social media in efforts to stifle descent.

But one solution could be for police officers to start wearing video cameras, just as many departments have installed dashboard video cameras in their cars. These cameras could both protect the police officers who are doing their jobs from unfounded accusations, and deter them from abusing their power. In {one test}<hyperlink=""http://www.policefoundation.org/body-worn-camera-study-by-executive-fellow-chief-tony-farrar-is-published-in-scientific-journal/""> in which members of a California department wore body cameras, the use of force against suspects and complaints about police abuse plummeted.

But until we have more accountability built into the system; until American law enforcement reverses its increasing tendency to regard communities as war zones and the people in them as enemy combatants; and until police and prosecutors are punished when they abuse people’s civil liberties – perhaps we should keep our phones handy.",206,1722,"Until the police stops treating communities as war zones and people as enemy combatants, keep your phone handy",NA

The unexpected announcement by Jay Nixon, made at a raucous press conference, marked another shift in law enforcement tactics which have veered from overtly militarised to inclusive and conciliatory in an effort to contain protests over last Saturday’s killing of Michael Brown, 18. 

Nixon, a Democrat, said the latest measure were necessary after a small group of looters smashed windows, lobbed bottles and ransacked three stores {on Friday night.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/ferguson-police-michael-brown-protesters""> The looters sabotaged not just property but the community’s peaceful protests, he said.

“We must have – and maintain – peace,” he said. “The eyes of the world are watching.” The curfew was scheduled to start at midnight and be lifted at 5am, local time.

As the curfew approached, hundreds of people gathered in the main street where clashes have taken place over the past week. Some drove through in cars with music blaring, and passengers sitting on the roof or hanging out of windows.

Dozens of police officers dressed in riot gear, some holding assault rifles, started filing in more than two hours before midnight, lining the street and guarding store fronts from potential looters. Several people called abuse to them as they passed.

[tweetbegin 500836108964335616 tweetend]

Heavy rain, thunder and lightning occasionally flashing on the horizon appeared to be doing little to deter the mainly young and African American crowd to return to their homes. Few present expressed confidence that the street would empty by midnight.

“They’re letting this all build up,” said Jamal Harris, 23. “They could be out here gradually correcting things, mingling with us. But people are drinking, smoking and getting fired up. It could go down again.”

Observers from Amnesty International, which earlier on Saturday condemned curfews as the tool of dictators, were walking the street in bright yellow tshirts to monitor the situation.

At the earlier press conference, Nixon said the media would be given access to the curfew zone in order to observe it and ensure transparency. 

Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri state highway patrol, handed responsibility for policing the protests {on Thursday}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/ferguson-disarming-tactics-of-highway-patrol-pay-dividends-as-calm-descends""> when it was taken out of the hands of the St Louis County police, tried to placate angry shouts from activists who attended the press conference, held in a church.

The curfew did not mean a return to military-style policing, he promised. “We won’t enforce it with tanks,” he said. “We won’t enforce it with teargas.” But it remained unclear how a curfew could be maintained without the use of at least some force.

Community leaders who flanked Nixon and Johnson appeared to welcome the move but some residents and outside activists called it counterproductive and feared its enforcement could fuel a new round of mayhem.

“I don’t think this was wise,” Malik Shabazz, the president of Black Lawyers for Justice, told the Guardian. “This could backfire.” Expecting people to stay indoors on a Saturday night was unrealistic, he said, adding that the move also sabotaged increasingly organised efforts by volunteers to rein in the troublemakers. Shabazz, a former leader of the Black Panthers, and who has a history of anti-Semitic views, came to {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> to organise some of the protests.

Police and protesters have repeatedly clashed since Brown was fatally shot in sharply disputed circumstances. For the first few nights Ferguson police and St Louis county police used tear gas and armoured vehicles to try to cow largely peaceful demonstrations, prompting criticism from {President Barack Obama}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/obama-ferguson-police-excessive-force-michael-brown""> and protests across the US.

Nixon tried to calm the situation by appointing Johnson, an African-American, the de facto commander on the ground. A savvy communicator, Johnson personally engaged with protesters and ordered his officers to stand back.

The approach brought peaceful, exuberant scenes on Thursday, with cavalcades of honking horns, but a small riot marred Friday’s peaceful protests – and left Johnson facing criticism that his officers had stood by as business were ransacked. Jay Kanzler, a lawyer for the owner of Ferguson Market and Liquor, {said police did nothing to stop the pillage.}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/16/us/missouri-teen-shooting/""> “They were told to stand down and I don’t know why,” he said.

Tanya Littleton, the owner of a beauty supply store, also criticised police after thieves stole hundreds of dollars’ worth of hair extensions. Other residents streamed towards stores to form human barriers and curb the looting. In the morning they swept broken glass and tried to repair damage. So many turned up to help the owners had to turn people away.

Community leaders vowed to organise and form a better defence for subsequent nights, helped by members of the Outcast and Dominant Breed motorcycle clubs who lined their bikes up in front of stores. But the curfew announcement undercut the budding volunteer force. Continuing anger over Brown’s death erupted at the press conference, which developed into a rowdy town hall meeting. Several speakers demanded the arrest of Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who shot Brown after an alleged scuffle in his patrol car.

“You need to charge that officer with murder,” one shouted, drawing cheers. “Indict him!” shouted another, to more cheers.

Friday’s violence came after the release by police of surveillance footage that implicated Brown in the theft of a packet of cigars from a convenience store a few minutes before he was shot. In the early hours of Saturday morning, a small crowd later looted the convenience store. A meat market was also looted and other businesses had windows smashed. Police did not intervene.

Brown’s family condemned the release of the film as a “character assassination” designed to smear the teenager and divert attention from the actions of police. The FBI, which is conducting a federal civil rights investigation into the shooting, and has had a copy of the footage for some days, {made it known that it disapproved of its release,}<hyperlink=
""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/feds-urged-police-not-release-michael-brown-robbery-video-n182346""> NBC reported.

Dozens of FBI agents are in Ferguson investigating the shooting. Key details of the incident remain unclear, including the number of shots fired. Wilson, who has been on the force for four years and is said to have a blemish-free disciplinary record, is on unpaid leave.

Neighbours told reporters who visited Wilson’s St Louis home that the officer and his family {appeared to have left}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/at-darren-wilsons-house-neighbors-say-he-and-his-family-took-off/""> several days ago.

It’s no wonder why they, in return, are viewed {as an occupying force.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/14/ferguson-occupation-peace-calm"">

I was the city police chief during 1999’s so-called “Battle in {Seattle}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/seattle"">,” the clash between anti-globalization protesters and my police officers. I realize now that the way we looked – and the way we behaved – provoked and exacerbated the violence. My decision to authorize the use of so-called “hard gear” (black uniforms with ballistic helmets and face shields, and the use of chemical agents) in our interactions with nonviolent, nonthreatening World Trade Organization demonstrators heightened tensions and put everyone – cops and citizens – at greater risk. The militarization of the WTO protests did untold damage to our efforts to build a positive, trusting partnership with our community.

I’m saddened to have watched the situation unfold in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> and see almost none of the lessons I’ve tried to offer since then put into effect. It’s difficult to implement any best practices when the everyday relationship between a city’s cops and its citizens is so broken.

It may be too late to have prevented violence in Ferguson, but the community and others like it must come together now and make immediate changes to establish a baseline of behavior for law enforcement – to abide by today and to build upon for the future. The situation in Ferguson is no longer just about Michael Brown’s death: it’s about systemic racism and patterns of neglect, about leadership and the ability to influence angry, sometimes criminally motivated, individuals. Beyond the lifted curfews and long after the National Guard’s presence attempts to restore some semblance of peace, real accountability for everyone’s actions – cops and citizens – is imperative.

First, leaders in Ferguson need to put together a large, representative, credible crisis team to work with the police, communicate systematically with the community and, most importantly, elicit grassroots suggestions for resolution of the conflict. While some leaders have already tried to do this on an ad hoc basis, their work needs to be institutionalized and expanded to include others.

Thereafter, the city or state government should convene a group of citizens, officers, politicians and civic leaders to craft and quickly implement a statement of non-negotiable standards for the performance and conduct of each and every police officer: for example, any officer should be fired if found to be using racial or ethnic slurs or excessive force. Those local officials should create a citizens’ review board (and a process for filling it) and give it investigative authority and subpoena powers, rather than rely on the local prosecutor and police to investigate their friends and colleagues – rather than just waiting around for the US Department of Justice and FBI to complete their own independent investigations.

The Ferguson police department’s disciplinary system will need to be overhauled – with the oversight of the citizens’ review board – to created a dual-track system for police offenders: those found through an independent investigation to have made honest mistakes or have “routine” performance problems should be subject to corrective action (coaching, counseling, schooling); and those found to have engaged in willful misconduct, gross negligence or recklessness should be subject to punitive actions (up through and including dismissal and, in appropriate cases, criminal prosecution).

Meanwhile, the police department needs to immediately begin a process of demilitarization and replace the military model with a community policing model. As part of that, they should adopt the {“Memphis model”}<hyperlink=""http://www.citinternational.org/training-overview/163-memphis-model.html""> of crisis intervention – requiring every employee to undergo a week of intensive training in defusing and de-escalation techniques conducted by mental health and communications experts. And they need to prohibit Swat operations for anything other than school shootings, armed hostage situations and other immediate crises when negotiations fail and lives are at stake. So should every police department in America.

It’s clear that Ferguson’s police officers, politicians and community leaders haven’t yet really embraced a philosophy of “community policing”, and that they weren’t working in partnership to identify and solve crime, traffic and other community-police problems – {not with a police force that is 93% white in a city that is two-thirds black,}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/us/ferguson-mo-complex-racial-history-runs-deep-most-tensions-have-to-do-police-force.html?_r=0""> or {with a trove of military garb waiting in the wings.}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/14/ferguson-s-cops-are-armed-like-i-was-in-iraq.html""> Some in the Ferguson area, {like Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/17/ron-johnson-ferguson-cop-middle-road-critics""> understand the basics.

After nights of unrest, during which police fired teargas and rubber bullets at protesters who hurled abuse, rocks and occasionally worse, captain Ron Johnson signalled that things had changed by leading a peaceful march of demonstrators through the centre of the town on Thursday.

“We’re going to have the approach that we’re in this together,” the state highway patrolman had told reporters in his deep baritone a couple of hours earlier, after being handed control of the protests over the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, by a police officer.

Johnson won early plaudits for his hands-off strategy, and his easy manner with people who had taken to the streets persuaded many that he felt their pain. He allowed a carnival-like demonstration to swell later on Thursday on the spot where earlier clashes had raged.

“I think we handled it just right,” he said the next morning, pledging to repeat the tactics that night.

But the euphoria faded fast. Late on Friday, pockets of rioting brought back the armoured trucks, riot gear and teargas. Later still, after police retreated, small crowds began looting shops, most notably one where Brown allegedly shoplifted cigars before he died.

Governor Jay Nixon finally had enough. On Saturday afternoon, the embattled Democrat declared a state of emergency and a curfew from midnight to 5am, effective immediately, in this northern suburb of St Louis that is home to about 21,000 people.

“We can’t have looting and crimes at night,” he said. “We can’t have people fearful.”

After all the heady acclaim, Johnson abruptly found himself forced to abandon his policy of giving demonstrators the “chance to express what they are feeling”. From Saturday night, he had to enforce an order for them to stay in their homes.

Johnson’s appointment seemed a savvy one. Announcing his role on Thursday afternoon, having wrested control of the protests for his state troopers from St Louis County, Nixon stressed that the trooper, who is 51, “grew up in this area”. The contrast with the outsiders who had led the earlier crackdown was clear.

Nixon and Thomas Jackson, the city’s police chief, have seemed distant and unsteady in public appearances since the shooting. By contrast Johnson speaks with a statesmanlike authority and empathy uncommon in a regional transport police chief whose job more typically involves urging the state’s drivers to stop texting at the wheel.

Hours before his appointment, he visited a local high school to reassure rattled students the violence would stop. One girl was crying, he said.

“And I can tell you that I almost had tears in my eyes,” he told reporters, as tears welled in his eyes. “But I told her we’re going to make a change, we’re going to make a difference.”

He gave the students his address, and told them to write him a letter about how the crisis had affected them. “And when this is over, I am going to read that to the troopers,” he said.

Unlike Jackson and 94% of his officers, as well as Nixon and St Louis County chief Jon Belmar, who are all white, Johnson, like most of the young demonstrators, is African American. Asked by the Guardian on Thursday night how he was managing to get his message through, he said, “I know a lot of them” and “we have to be reflective of our community.”

After marching with them, he told protesters to hearty applause they could stay as long they wanted if they kept traffic moving.

A 27-year veteran of the state highway patrol, Johnson leads almost 150 officers in troop C, which covers eastern {Missouri.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> He began his career in the same troop, won promotions, then left in 1999 for a job near Kansas City. But, as he told reporters earlier this week: “I called my wife one day and said you know what? We need to go back home, go back to our family and friends.”

He was promoted to captain and returned to where he began his career.

But for all the emphasis on Johnson’s local roots, he has graduated to a position of authority and an affluent lifestyle from which most young men in Ferguson are far removed.

He and his wife, Lori, live in a four-bedroom house in neighbouring Florissant, in an area where the population is two-thirds white and the average income is almost $80,000 – more than two and a half times the typical earnings where Brown was killed, where 81% of residents are black. His wife has run several businesses, according to state records, and the couple have been {photographed together in St Louis Town & Style.}<hyperlink=""http://images.mycapture.com/38349967.jpg?function=resize&mode=SCALE&width=600&maxheight=430"">

Johnson’s daughter, Amanda, said in an {interview published by the University of Kansas,}<hyperlink=""http://emilytaylorcenter.dept.ku.edu/wod-1314/johnson.shtml""> where she was an honours student, that her father was one of her role models and best friends.

“I have been able to watch him continue to achieve greatness and promotions my whole life,” she said. “His leadership and advice have set a foundation and a standard for the ways that I interact with and lead others.”

His bold decision to force the police to remove the gas masks from their belts and step back on Thursday appeared successful. Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the centre of Ferguson, chanting in memory of Brown while honking their horns and playing music. The captain was hauled through packed crowds to appear in front of cable news cameras, frantically wiping the sweat from head and face with a handkerchief. The peace held.

But then came Friday. While some hailed Johnson as a hero – hugging him, chatting to him and even laying hands on him – other residents directed rage at him for the disclosure that morning, by the separate Ferguson police, of a report alleging Brown committed a robbery minutes before his death. Lawyers for Brown’s family condemned it as “character assassination”. Johnson was left saying he wished he had been consulted. “I would have communicated it differently,” he said.

It was an unexpected consequence of Johnson’s pointed policy of allowing residents to join reporters at press conferences. Having been pushed out in front as a public figurehead, he found himself viewed by residents unfussed by jurisdictional technicalities as the man in charge of the entire Michael Brown saga, leaving him to defend decisions over which he had no control, while attempting to prevent them fuelling further chaos on the streets.

He was to be disappointed. Following an evening of largely peaceful demonstrations, Missourians awoke on Saturday to familiar-looking TV footage. Armoured trucks and fresh clouds of teargas rolled along West Florissant Avenue soon after midnight after bottles and rocks were thrown at police. Three officers were injured. Young men had later vandalised and stolen from stores with no police to be seen. The governor decided on drastic action.

Standing alongside Nixon on Saturday, Johnson tried hard to explain that the teargas was set off by one officer acting independently. He said that he got back out of bed and returned to the scene, telling the officers: “Make sure we’re not going to use any force that’s not necessary.” But left unsaid was that what followed this call was more looting.

A humbled Johnson was forced to support a draconian Nixon plan sharply at odds with Thursday’s liberal idyll: the five-hour curfew. “We won’t enforce it with tanks, we won’t enforce it with teargas,” he said. Lambasted by furious audience-members for the lack of public disclosure about the inquiry into Brown’s shooting, which is being led, controversially, by the county authorities, he was forced to stress that he had no role in that either.

For the vilified officers of St Louis County, it was a moment of pure schadenfreude. “This has been a dismal failure,” said detective Gabe Crocker, the president of the St Louis County Police Association. “The highway patrol’s approach on Saturday was let them loose. Don’t engage them. But they still rioted, they still looted. It got so bad that the very tactics they said they wouldn’t use, they had to use.

“I get what they were trying to do with Johnson. But I think it was a cheap attempt to gain political points by putting an African American in charge. I get what they were trying to do, but it just didn’t work.”

And for some young people on the streets in Ferguson, a cop is a cop is a cop.

Johnson tried peacemaking on Friday afternoon with a group, some with bandana-covered faces, who were gathered outside the convenience store that Brown allegedly robbed. Their leader, who called himself Mike Mike, was complaining that one of the police officers guarding the store had disrespected him.

Johnson noted the commotion, approached and asked what had happened. As the youths clustered around he listened to the grievance, nodded and said all opinions deserved to be aired and respected, and that his officers knew that.

Mike Mike listened but did not appear mollified. His friends piped up about other alleged slights, and Johnson tried a bit of flattery. “I talked about you on CNN,” he told Mike Mike. “I think your voice is important. And remember, just now I walked over to you.”

The youth half-smiled. “OK, so I’m good with Captain Johnson. But what about these other officers?” He shook his head. Johnson was cool, he said, but it was a shame he wore a badge. “We wish you were a firefighter, or something, because you are ice.”

Afterwards, Mike Mike told the Guardian he respected Johnson as a human being. The badge, however, remained a problem. “It’s the fact that he’s a cop. It’s the company he keeps.”

A few hours later, a handful of looters attacked the store.

Some proved even more difficult to win over. As Johnson gave media interviews amid a crowd of protesters on Thursday night, Kesheara Ross, 26, listened to his remarks and snorted.

“There would be no meaningful police reform, she predicted. “They’re not going to make any changes. I’ve heard all the same stuff after other shootings.” She gave the captain a withering look. “Uncle Tom-ass brothers.”",199,952,"Local police and protesters alike turn on state highway patrol captain Ron Johnson, brought in to give a softer face to law enforcement",NA

19 Aug 2014 17:26: Hedy Epstein, the 90-year-old Holocaust survivor arrested while protesting the situation in Ferguson, said “racism is alive and well in the United States,” {in an interview with Newsweek.}<hyperlink=""http://www.newsweek.com/holocaust-survivor-hedy-epstein-arrested-ferguson-protest-says-racism-alive-america-265703"">

Epstein was arrested after refusing to leave a protest outside the Wainwright state building in downtown St Louis, where demonstrators had gathered to ask {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> governor Jay Nixon to deescalate law enforcement’s response to demonstrations.

“I’m deeply, deeply troubled by what’s going on in {Ferguson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson"">” Epstein told Newsweek. “It’s a matter of racism and injustice, and it’s not only in Ferguson…. Racism is alive and well in the United States. The power structure looks at anyone who’s different as the other, as less worthy, and so you treat the other as someone who is less human and who needs to be controlled and who is not trusted.”

19 Aug 2014 17:18: US attorney general Eric Holder pledged that the federal government’s investigation into the shooting will be “fair” and “independent” in {an editorial posted on the St Louis Post-Dispatch website this afternoon.}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/a-message-to-the-people-of-ferguson/article_ea8b7358-67a3-5187-af8c-169567f27a0d.html"">

“At the core of these demonstrations is a demand for answers about the circumstances of this young man’s death and a broader concern about the state of our criminal justice system,” Holder said.

“At a time when so much may seem uncertain, the people of {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> can have confidence that the Justice Department intends to learn — in a fair and thorough manner — exactly what happened.”

He said “the full resources of the department of justice” are being used in the investigation, including the deployment of about 40 FBI agents and prosecutors in the department’s civil rights division.

He also called for calm in the streets, while acknowledging that it is being done by “a very small minority.”

“The Justice Department will defend the right of protesters to peacefully demonstrate and for the media to cover a story that must be told,” Holder said. “But violence cannot be condoned. I urge the citizens of Ferguson who have been peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights to join with law enforcement in condemning the actions of looters, vandals and others seeking to inflame tensions and sow discord.”

19 Aug 2014 17:02: St Louis mayor Francis G Slay has just made a statement about the fatal police shooting that occurred earlier this afternoon:

19 Aug 2014 16:41: The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has {issued a statement}<hyperlink=""https://www.cpj.org/2014/08/cpj-condemns-ongoing-harassment-arrests-of-reporte.php""> condemning the arrest of journalists in Ferguson.

The group said it “is alarmed by the continued harassment and detentions of journalists” covering protests in the city. At least 11 reporters have been arrested since the protests began, {according to CNN.}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-journalists-arrested/"">

“Ferguson is an international story and journalists are going to cover it. They have a right to do so without fearing for their safety or liberty,” said CPJ deputy director Robert Mahoney. “The harassment and detention of reporters must stop. From senior commanders on down, the word must go out to security forces to let journalists do their job.”

19 Aug 2014 16:21: We have more details on the police shooting that happened around 12:30pm local time in St Louis on Tuesday and left a 23-year-old African American man dead.

Crowds that had gathered at the scene of the shooting became rowdy during a press conference with St Louis police chief Sam Dotson, chanting the refrain popularized by the {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> protests: “Hands up, don’t shoot.”

Area residents were able to temporarily calm the crowd until the end of the press conference, when shouting resumed, {according to the St Louis Dispatch.}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/article_85d27316-a17a-5e0a-b1d6-8a6753e2fcb2.html#.U_Oe3usytdw.twitter""> Dotson then entered the crowd and repeated the information he had shared with the press.

Some members of the crowd asked why tasers were not used to stop the man, who was wielding a knife as he approached police. But tasers are not standard issue for St Louis police, {said MSNBC’s Christopher Hayes.}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/501818456728436737"">

The officers involved have been placed on administrative duty pending an investigation, Dotson said.

19 Aug 2014 16:04: {NPR spoke with Ferguson residents}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/08/19/341608860/reality-meets-celebrity-in-ferguson-mo""> who insist that despite the city’s history of segregation, it has never had a strong activist culture. “I think the fact that St. Louis is the catalyst for a nationwide conversation is highly ironic,” said resident Etefia Umana. More from NPR: 

Saulsberry tells me about her daughter Mya, who just graduated from Missouri’s Culver-Stockton College and who spent part of the semester in California with Angela Davis. The tragedy in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> has activated young people like her Mya, she says.
On cue, Mya materializes, holding a sign. “I never thought I’d have to practice civil disobedience so soon,” she says. She’s been at most of the rallies and protests. “If I’m not at work, I’m out here in these Ferguson streets.”
Though everyone is exceedingly polite on Canfield, some folks say there are some tensions. “There’s a generational divide,” says Demetrius Upchurch, a high school teacher from a few towns over who’s here with his 4-year-old son, Aiden. He’s visiting some family; his 85-year-old grandfather lives near the street where Michael Brown was killed. Upchurch says his grandfather is scared by the unrest. “Old people don’t understand younger people, and younger people don’t understand older people.”
He says he tries to keep it real with his students about the police, and lets them know they can talk to him. He tells us a story from a few months back about how his son and fianceé saw him roughed up and thrown on the ground by some local police officers. It seems a lot of people here have stories about the police. He says it’s important for leadership to come from the generations raised on hip-hop, “not just some old Christian pastor who was around when Martin Luther King was around.” The allusion to Jackson is not missed.

19 Aug 2014 15:35: A grand jury will hear from witnesses to the shooting of Michael Brown on Wednesday, {according to the Washington Post.}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/19/grand-jury-to-hear-evidence-in-michael-browns-death-on-wednesday/"">

“We know this is of interest to a lot of people around the country,” Edward Magee, a spokesperson for the office of St Louis County prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch, told The Washington Post. “We’re going to do this fairly and also attempt to do it in a timely manner.”

Evidence will be presented to a 12 member jury so they can determine whether or not the information is sufficient return an indictment on the case. {More from the Post:}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/19/grand-jury-to-hear-evidence-in-michael-browns-death-on-wednesday/"">

McCulloch met with his lead prosecutors on Tuesday at 1:30 pm to review the status of the investigation and the evidence that has been gathered so far. Meanwhile, in {Ferguson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> protesters and some elected officials have been calling on McCulloch to step aside as the prosecutor and have an independent special prosecutor handle the case involving Wilson.
In a grand jury investigation, a prosecutor alone determines whether to recommend specific criminal charges be brought. The jury can ask questions to determine whether the evidence warrants the charges, while no outside lawyers for the victim or the defendant can be present or ask questions.

19 Aug 2014 15:08: The victim had stolen two energy drinks from a convenience store and was wielding a knife and acting erratically, said Dotson.

Dotson said witnesses could hear the man saying: “shoot me now, kill me now.”

He said the man did not respond to demands to drop his weapon as he approached the officers, carrying the knife with an overhand gesture. The man was within three to four feet of the officers when they shot him.

“I think officer safety is the number one issue,” Dotson said.

• The Michael Brown shooting investigation is going smoothly a US attorney said {in an interview with Time.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/19/ferguson-crisis-31-arrested-michael-brown-protests#block-53f38319e4b092330feea08e""> “While the lack of details surrounding the shooting may frustrate the media and breed suspicion among those already distrustful of the system, those closely guarded details give law enforcement the best yardsticks for measuring whether witnesses are truthful,” said Richard A Callahan. This update comes a day before US attorney general Eric Holder is set to arrive in Ferguson.

• The Ferguson-Florissant School District has {delayed the start of school}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/19/ferguson-crisis-31-arrested-michael-brown-protests#block-53f366bbe4b0f23fdd935253""> into next week because of “continued unrest in and around Ferguson.” Despite the cancellation, teachers carried signs offering to educate students outside a local library in the morning.

• {The Guardian’s Rory Carroll examined the protesters}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/ferguson-outsiders-protesters-riots-peaceful-unrest""> who are said to be outside agitators bent on maintaining the chaos. “If you don’t live here you don’t worry about the burning and looting,” said Steve Beale, 27, who works at an electrical goods store.

• UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon called on US authorities to be sure they are protecting the rights of protesters in Ferguson. “The Secretary-General calls on the authorities to ensure that the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are protected,” {a UN spokesperson said.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/19/ferguson-crisis-31-arrested-michael-brown-protests#block-53f3698ae4b0ab8524dca196"">

19 Aug 2014 13:53: Police arrested 78 people in Ferguson during the most recent overnight protests, according to {NBC News}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/78-arrested-overnight-most-missouri-arrest-records-show-n184036""> and {local St Louis news channel KSDK,}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/19/78-arrests-ferguson-overnight/14290361/""> which published a list reportedly from St Louis Justice Services.

Only four people arrested are residents of {Ferguson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> 50 are residents of the St Louis area and 19 are out-of-state residents. The remaining five are from other parts of Missouri.

Of those arrests, 75 were for failure to disperse, two were for unlawful use of a weapon and one person, from Illinois, was arrested for interfering with an officer.

19 Aug 2014 13:32: QuikTrip, a company that had a store location looted and destroyed during protests, said it is making sure employees at its {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> location have access to counseling and is offering to transfer them to nearby stores.

“Honestly, the only focus we have is we’re taking care of employees and customers at other locations,” {QuickTrip spokesperson Michael Thornbrugh told Tulsa World.}<hyperlink=""http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/retail/quiktrip-responds-to-st-louis-riot-damage/article_0484cda0-7e6d-5a67-91b6-ba6471420fb4.html""> “We’ve been unable to even go in and do anything else at the location.”

The company has not decided whether it will rebuild the store and is leaving security issues to local police. “With all due respect, there’s nothing left to protect,” {he told the St Louis Business Journal.}<hyperlink=""http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/blog/2014/08/quiktrip-coming-to-grips-with-destruction-of.html"">

“While the lack of details surrounding the shooting may frustrate the media and breed suspicion among those already distrustful of the system, those closely guarded details give law enforcement the best yardsticks for measuring whether witnesses are truthful,” said Richard A Callahan, US attorney for the eastern district of {Missouri.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> “Without those yardsticks, an investigation becomes more of a guessing game or popularity contest than a search for the truth.”

He said FBI agents have canvassed the area surrounding the shooting scene and are collecting informations from witnesses. Physical evidence is also being analyzed following the completion of an autopsy ordered by the federal government.

19 Aug 2014 12:46: Michael Brown’s parents said they believe protests in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> would end if justice was brought to the police officer who shot and killed their unarmed son. The officer, Darren Wilson, left his home shortly after Brown was shot and has not been charged with any crimes.

“Justice will bring peace I believe,” Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s mother, {told the Today show’s Matt Lauer in a Monday morning interview.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/michael-brown-parents-ferguson-justice-peace""> “Him being arrested, charges being filed and a prosecution.

19 Aug 2014 12:15: The Guardian’s {Rory Carroll}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/rorycarroll72""> has been on the ground in Ferguson since last week. He checked out claims that many of the most volatile protesters are outsiders who showed up in Ferguson because they are attracted to the chaos. {Carroll reports:}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/ferguson-outsiders-protesters-riots-peaceful-unrest"">

Volunteers – locals and outsiders – had for a time {kept a fragile peace}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/obama-attorney-general-eric-holder-ferguson""> by linking arms and forcing rowdy youths, many covering their faces with masks and bandannas, {back from lines of police with riot gear}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/aug/19/protests-michael-brown-killing-ferguson-missouri-in-pictures""> and armoured vehicles.
“Relax. If we relax, they relax,” said one man with a megaphone. For a time it worked, and it seemed {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> could break the cycle of violent confrontation.
Then, about 500 metres down the other end of the avenue, in front of the ruins of a destroyed QuikTrip store that has been a focus of the protests here, a small group of youths tore up street signs and threw bottles at police. Then at least one of them opened fire, triggering a heavy police response of stun grenades and teargas which made the town, yet again, resemble a war zone.
“If you don’t live here you don’t worry about the burning and looting,” said Steve Beale, 27, who works at an electrical goods store. “You don’t worry about stores closing, or losing your job, or walking for miles to buy food. Well, I live here and I do worry.”

19 Aug 2014 11:58: The City of Ferguson has called for “nighttime quiet and reconciliation” per a release handed out on Tuesday and published by {reporter Faith Abubéy.}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/ReporterFaith/status/501755013048590336"">

“It is our hope that as we continue to work for the wellbeing of {Ferguson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> residents will stay home at night, allow peace to settle in, and allow for the justice process to take its course,” the flyer said. “We owe it to our children to be able to return to school and work together peacefully for Ferguson’s future.”

“We plan to learn from this tragedy, as we further provide for the safety of our residents and businesses and progress our community through reconciliation and healing.”

It said that city leadership is working with “existing community relationships” and residents to start a new dialogue and create long and short term solutions to the city’s issues. The release says they are exploring actions including efforts to increase the amount of black law enforcement officers, encourage police officers to live in the city and work to acquire dash and vest cams on police officers.

Initiatives to improve local business and youth programs are also being explored, the city said.

19 Aug 2014 11:44: Norm Stamper, a Seattle police chief from 1994 to 2000, {writes for The Guardian}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/19/ferguson-police-force-punish-cops""> about how the police can work with its community in times of protest, like he tried to do during the 1999 WTO protests.

Meanwhile, the police department needs to immediately begin a process of demilitarization and replace the military model with a community policing model. As part of that, they should adopt the “Memphis model” of crisis intervention – requiring every employee to undergo a week of intensive training in defusing and de-escalation techniques conducted by mental health and communications experts. And they need to prohibit Swat operations for anything other than school shootings, armed hostage situations and other immediate crises when negotiations fail and lives are at stake. So should every police department in America.
It’s clear that Ferguson’s police officers, politicians and community leaders haven’t yet really embraced a philosophy of “community policing”, and that they weren’t working in partnership to identify and solve crime, traffic and other community-police problems – not with a police force that is 93% white in a city that is two-thirds black, or with a trove of military garb waiting in the wings. Some in the {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> area, like Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, understand the basics. But you can’t reverse the effects of years of military-style policing in a few hours of walking among protesters.
Still, law enforcement officers in Ferguson – and in so many other places – need to start somewhere. They need to start here ... or else they’ll just keep failing in all the same ways.

19 Aug 2014 11:30: Every night of demonstrations in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> is followed by a batch of volunteers showing up at the scenes of the protests in the morning to clean-up debris like gas canisters and broken glass.

“The Secretary-General calls on the authorities to ensure that the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are protected,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters.

“He calls on all to exercise restraint, for law enforcement officials to abide by U.S. and international standards in dealing with demonstrators,” Dujarric said.

19 Aug 2014 11:10: The Ferguson-Florissant School District has again delayed the start of school, cancelling classes through the week.

“We believe that closing schools for the rest of this week will allow needed time for peace and stability to be restored to our community and allow families to plan ahead for the additional days that children will be out of school,” {the district said on its homepage.}<hyperlink=""http://www.fergflor.org/pages/Ferguson-Florissant_SD"">

“While we deeply regret this delay to the start of the 2014-2015 school year, our first priority is the safety of our students.”

District officials made this decision after speaking with local law enforcement and district security staff.

The first day of school was supposed to be Thursday, 14 August, but school officials postponed the start to Monday because of the protests. It announced on Sunday night that classes would also be cancelled on Monday because of “continued unrest in and around {Ferguson.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson"">”

19 Aug 2014 10:50: Guardian columnist {Steven Thrasher}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/thrasherxy""> says that the real looting of Ferguson, and across the US, is that its black citizens are marginalized by structural racism. {Thrasher writes:}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/19/ferguson-looting-national-guard-black-citizens-get-by"">

It’s not like the “best” stores of {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> – the McDonald’s or the Walgreen’s, for instance – provide much more than minimum wage jobs, barely helpful for subsistence living. The dollar stores pedaling cheap goods and unhealthy food that no one needs aren’t much better. And it’s undeniable that the worst of Ferguson’s businesses – the many legal loan sharks who blight its streets – are actively strangling the last breaths from Ferguson’s black residents who are already on the margins.
Will looting solve any of this? No. But will bringing in the National Guard to protect the very loan sharks and fast food restaurants who are exploiting us? Hell no! And let’s face it: fear of these businesses getting destroyed is what’s bringing the troops in, not big-picture concerns about the legal looting of human lives. Racism, looting {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> since crackers owned slaves, lit Ferguson on fire – not some looter with a firecracker.
Too often, a call for non-violence becomes a blanket excuse to do nothing and maintain the status quo. The National Guard is coming in to maintain the status quo and that is unacceptable – because black Missourians, like most African Americans, were already drowning in the status quo when Mike Brown was still alive.

19 Aug 2014 10:38: Missouri state highway patrol captain Ron Johnson {became emotional}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2014/08/19/captain-ron-johnson-gives-emotional-speech-during-early-morning-press-conference-in-ferguson/""> at a 2.20am press conference on Monday morning as he discussed the continued chaos in Ferguson.

“We’re going to make this neighbourhood whole, we’re going to make this community whole, and we’re going to do it together,” {said Johnson, close to tears.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/ferguson-police-national-guard-michael-brown-missouri-crisis""> “And I am not going to let criminals who come here from across the country or live in this community define this neighbourhood.”

19 Aug 2014 10:21: Welcome to our live coverage of the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, where national guard intervention has {failed to bring calm to the streets}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/ferguson-police-national-guard-michael-brown-missouri-crisis""> as protesters continue to demonstrate following the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown 10 days ago.

Police arrested 31 people during the overnight protests, which were marked by gunfire, teargas and stun grenades. Those arrested include people from as far away as New York and California, said Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri state highway patrol during an early morning press conference. {Police also arrested a Getty photographer on Monday.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-police-arrest-photographer-scott-olsen"">

Johnson defended law enforcement’s response to the demonstrations and urged protesters to contain demonstrations to daytime in order to prevent the “tiny minority of lawbreakers” from getting cover in the night.

As community members clean up gas cans, broken bottles and other debris on Tuesday morning, people are waiting to see if the riots continue into this evening or if peace can be brought to the city.

But police also released security camera footage and an incident report that implicated the victim, 18-year-old Michael Brown, in an earlier robbery at a convenience store, infuriating his family and prompting concerns of new tensions in the area.

The Browns’ attorney said they were “beyond outraged” by the revelation, which came unaccompanied by any further details of the shooting. The family’s lawyer, Benjamin Crump, described the report as a “brutal assassination” of Brown’s character.

In a further development, police later disclosed that the officer who shot Brown was not even aware of the robbery, which had taken place a few minutes earlier. Ferguson’s local police chief, Thomas Jackson, was pressured to explain why the information about the robbery had been released at the same time. Crump accused police of playing a game of “smoke and mirrors”.

Jackson identified the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson, a six-year veteran of the city police department. He said that Wilson had a clean disciplinary record before the shooting on Saturday.

The disclosure brought an end to wide-ranging speculation and rumour that residents said was stoking disgruntlement. Several names had previously been published online and circulated locally, forcing police to issue denials.

The refusal to disclose any further information about the shooting of Brown, combined with the revelation of a partial account of events that allegedly preceded it, threatened to revive hostilities in a town where protests {gave way to a carnival-like atmosphere on Thursday night.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/ferguson-disarming-tactics-of-highway-patrol-pay-dividends-as-calm-descends"">

A brief section in the incident report tied the robbery to Brown’s killing, which it said was “worth mentioning”. The report read: “In that incident, Brown was fatally wounded involving an officer of this department.” No further details of the killing were offered.

Captain Ron Johnson of the {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> state highway patrol, who won plaudits for his handling of the demonstrations after being handed control on Thursday, said he “would have liked to have been consulted” about the simultaneous release of the report of the name and alleged robbery.

“The information could have been put out in a different way,” Johnson told reporters and residents at a press conference that unfolded more like a town hall meeting on Friday. “I would have communicated it differently,” he told the Guardian afterwards.

The disagreement over Friday’s decision highlighted the overlapping jurisdictions of the law enforcement agencies involved. The robbery report was released by {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> city police, the force that employs the officer who shot Brown, which has come under sharp criticism for not reflecting the racial makeup of the city, which is majority African American.

The inquiry into the shooting is being led by St Louis County police, which led the policing of the demonstrations over Brown’s death through {several nights of violent clashes,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-teargas-rubber-bullets-michael-brown""> before being relieved by Nixon on Thursday. Control of the security for protests was handed to Johnson and the state highway patrol, whose dramatic shift in tactics away from a hardline response was credited with allowing the calmer atmosphere on Thursday night.

Nonetheless, residents expressed fury at Johnson on Friday over the actions of the separate city police force. “There’s a lot of evidence come out about [Brown’s] character, and what he was before the shooting,” said Carl Walter, 38. “Why is there not the same transparency about this officer? This young man lost his life.”

Governor Jay Nixon conceded at the same press conference that “certain things should have come out sooner than they did later”.

“New facts are out that weren’t out yesterday,” said Nixon. “But those are not the full picture of anything.” He added: “Nothing should deter figuring out how and why Michael Brown was killed.”

According to the Ferguson police account of the robbery, witnesses told police that Brown stole several packets of Swisher Sweet cigars from a convenience store between 11.52am and 11.54am on 9 August.

Store surveillance footage shows that “an apparent struggle or confrontation seems to take place with Brown”, and then as he made to leave, an unidentified man tried to stop him. Brown pushed the man into a display rack, started to leave the store, appeared to intimidate the person one more time, then left, according to the report.

A friend, Dorian Johnson, was identified in the police report as being involved in the robbery. He was also present at the scene of the shooting, which took place a few minutes later and has spoken {several}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> {times}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlMjhoYPmZ8""> about the incident, contradicting claims by the police that Brown wrestled with Wilson before the shots were fired.

Jackson said on Friday the officer was treated for an injury sustained during his encounter with Brown. He had previously said that, following the incident, the officer had sustained a swollen face and was treated in hospital. Asked what had struck the officer’s face, Jackson told a press conference earlier this week: “Don’t know.”

Adding further tension between the various authorities involved, county prosecutor Bob McCulloch, who would be responsible for bringing any charges against the officer, reportedly reacted furiously to Nixon’s transfer of leading the policing the demonstrations. “It’s shameful what he did,” McCulloch {told the St Louis Post-Dispatch.}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/gov-nixon-gives-police-control-of-ferguson-situation-to-missouri/article_0806541b-ed48-5d06-9267-323531ad6cf1.html"">

Nixon declined to respond to McCulloch’s comments when asked on Friday. “We’re focused on our responsibility we have here,” he said.

Police were posted at the convenience store allegedly robbed by Brown. At least half a dozen officers from the highway patrol and county police, plus what appeared to be a plain clothes officer with a bulletproof vest, took position outside and inside the store around 1pm, hours after authorities posted security camera footage of the incident.

Staff initially told the Guardian it happened at another store but after police arrived they said they had no comment. “We have nothing to say,” said one woman at the cash register.

‘They’re good people. I’ve known them for over 10 years,” said Eugene Ward, 43, clutching a bag of water bottles and beer cans. “If the evidence shows that the gentleman was here and committed a crime that doesn’t change the excessive police reaction. But it also doesn’t condone what the young man did.”

About 150 people gathered for an afternoon demonstration in downtown St Louis, 12 miles south-east of Ferguson, where Michael Brown, 18, was shot repeatedly by Darren Wilson last Saturday afternoon. Some wielded placards with messages defending the 28-year-old officer and his family.

“He was doing his job,” said Kaycee Reinisch, 57, of Lincoln County, {Missouri.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> “And now because of public uproar in Ferguson, he is being victimised. He is being victimised by the whole city, the state and the federal government.” Reinisch said she had relations in law enforcement who would be “frightened to do their jobs” if Wilson were punished for the incident.

Witnesses have said that Brown was shot dead while fleeing a confrontation with Wilson after the officer asked him and a friend to move from the middle of the road to the pavement. Police contend that Brown assaulted Wilson, who received swelling to one side of his face and was treated in hospital. St Louis County police and prosecutors are investigating the shooting.

Sunday’s demonstrators said that they wanted to draw a contrast with what organisers called the “other side” – those seeking justice for Brown, who have mounted repeated nights of protest in which some threw bottles and rocks at heavily armed police, who have themselves repeatedly fired teargas and rubber bullets.

“We will be the example of what peaceful means,” the organisers told attendees in an online message beforehand. “No offensive signs, we are for support,” they said. “If the other side should show, we will not argue or fight.”

The demonstration was initially silent. Eventually the protesters – many wearing blue in a mark of support for the police – began cheering as passing cars honked their horns in agreement. One man riding a Harley-Davidson revved his engine loudly to generous applause.

While the crowds protesting in Ferguson have been predominantly African American, all but one of the demonstrators showing their support for Wilson were white. A stack of dark blue T-shirts, on sale for $7 and bearing a police-style badge stating: “Officer Darren Wilson – I stand by you,” quickly sold out.

One was bought by Martin Baker, a consultant and former Republican congressional primary candidate and the only black member of the crowd. “People are too quick to play the race card,” said Baker, 44, on widespread claims by black residents Ferguson residents that they are subjected to institutional racism by the city’s almost unanimously white authorities. “Lawlessness knows no colour.”

Baker said the demonstrators in Ferguson “want to see more crime, they want to see things get disrespectful. And there are some of us who refuse to allow it to happen.” He accused Brown of having a “criminalistic bent” after a police report released on Friday alleged that he had stolen cigars from a convenience store minutes before he died.

About a dozen police officers stood monitoring the protest from surrounding street corners. Five of them were on bicycles. Amid forecasts of storms in the area from the late afternoon, the demonstrators were also urged to attend at 5pm even through potential downpours: “Officer Wilson has endured a lot more than rain,” the organisers said. The weather stayed mild.

The protest was held outside the headquarters of KSDK, a local television news station, after it broadcast images of Wilson’s home. The station later removed the footage from its website and apologised “to our audience, to the surrounding neighborhoods, to the greater St Louis community and to the officer for our mistake.” Some protesters are now urging a boycott.

The demonstration grew out of a Facebook group dedicated to the support of Wilson, 28, who has been placed on paid leave and is in hiding for security. The group was created soon after his name was released to the public last Friday. By the time the demonstration began on Sunday, the group had attracted more than 12,500 likes.

“There is a great deal of support in the St Louis community, nationally, and internationally for officer Darren Wilson,” one of the organisers, who asked to be referred to as E M Baker, said in an email to the Guardian earlier on Sunday.

“We fully support officer Darren Wilson,” she said. “Our rally today is exclusively an opportunity for us to gather in ‘silence’ in a sea of blue to show officer Wilson, his family, the law enforcement community, and the world, that our support is strong and unwavering.”

Many group members have made postings casting doubt on the version of events offered by people who claim to have witnessed the shooting, while others attempted to explain why Wilson might have shot Brown.

“An officer doesn’t have xray vision,” wrote Jennifer Hall, of Robertsville, Missouri. “He can’t tell if you have weapon or not until searched. So you act in a suspicious manner, we know what the consequences are.”

Robin Barklage, who said he once lived in one of the apartment buildings overlooking the site of Brown’s shooting, said he believed police claims that Brown assaulted Wilson. “I believe he did what he had to do,” said Barklage. “No officer is going to go further then they need to.”

Others – none, apparently, from Ferguson – complained about the charges of police racism in a city where 50 of the 53 police officers are white, while the population is roughly two-thirds black. Figures compiled by the Missouri attorney general show that black residents are stopped and searched disproportionately by the police.

“Ferguson will now be forced to hire 10 African American police officers just because of this terrible ordeal,” said Damon Andersen of Imperial City, Missouri. “Let the black officers see how difficult it is to try and deal with the black criminals on the beat they are patrolling.”

The group administrators earlier asked members to leave their porch lights illuminated on Saturday evening as a gesture of support for Wilson. “Our light will burn until Mr Wilson can breathe in peace and enjoy life once again,” replied Randy Kopp, of Florissant.

Members from several different Missouri towns posted photographs of their porch lights switched on. They were joined by like-minded Wilson supporters from California, Florida, Michigan, Oklahoma and even as far afield as Kuwait.

Wilson is also being supported by Hunt For Justice, a group of volunteers from what it calls “the law enforcement community”, which provides assistance to “officers and their families in times of need, whatever the circumstances”.

The group is raising money for Wilson online and said “donations are coming in from all over the United States”. Hunt For Justice leaders have also created T-shirts to allow members to display public support. “Justice cannot be for one side alone,” a slogan reads on the back.",NA,6705,"Protesters, almost all of whom were white, say Darren Wilson is being victimised as they stage protest in St Louis",NA

Thomas Jackson, Ferguson’s chief of police, said at a press conference that the officer – named for the first time as Darren Wilson – did not know that Michael Brown, 18, was a suspect in the theft of cigars from a convenience store shortly before the encounter last Saturday afternoon.

At the same time he disclosed the officer’s identity, the police chief released surveillance footage and an incident report detailing how Brown had allegedly stolen from the store and physically confronted a member of staff. The move was described as a “character assassination” by lawyers for the Brown family.

Jackson first indicated that the officer stopped Brown in response to a callout over police radio describing the suspect for the robbery. Yet at a second press conference on Friday, Jackson said that the “initial contact was not related to the robbery”.

Brown was stopped because he was walking down the middle of the street, obstructing traffic, the police chief said.

Later still, Jackson was {quoted by the St Louis Post-Dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-officer-realized-during-encounter-that-michael-brown-might-be/article_52c40b84-ad90-5f9a-973c-70d628d0be04.html""> as saying that Wilson saw cigars in Brown’s hand and realised that he might be a suspect in the robbery.

Attorneys for the Browns said that the family were “beyond outraged” at the simultaneous release, describing it as a strategic move to smear their son.
“There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution-style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender,” the lawyers said in a joint statement.

Jackson said the report was released in response to freedom of information requests by media outlets, apparently following tip-offs. Such requests can often take weeks or months to be fulfilled.

His decision was also criticised due to the refusal by police to disclose comparable details about Brown’s shooting, despite this information being subject to similar records requests.

Dennis Parker, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s racial justice program, said Jackson had made a “one-sided and piecemeal disclosure of potentially irrelevant and prejudicial information while continuing to withhold the critical police incident report that the public has demanded”.

Captain Ron Johnson of the {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/missouri""> state highway patrol, who won plaudits for his handling of the demonstrations after being handed control on Thursday, said he “would have liked to have been consulted” about the simultaneous release of the report of the name and alleged robbery.

The FBI is also investigating whether the shooting breached civil rights. It announced late on Friday that agents would be “canvassing the neighbourhood” over the next few days to find new witnesses.

Control of the security for protests was handed to Johnson and the state highway patrol, whose dramatic shift in tactics away from a hardline response was credited with allowing the calmer atmosphere on Thursday night.

Nonetheless, residents expressed fury at Johnson on Friday over the actions of the separate city police force. “There’s a lot of evidence come out about [Brown’s] character, and what he was before the shooting,” said Carl Walter, 38. “Why is there not the same transparency about this officer?

Jackson said on Friday that Wilson was treated for an injury suffered during his encounter with Brown. He had previously said the officer sustained a swollen face. Wilson was placed on administrative leave and is understood to be in hiding outside Ferguson.

Wilson was described as a “gentle, quiet man”. Asked how the incident had affected the officer, who has worked for him for four years following two in a neighbouring force, Jackson said: “Devastating, devastating. He never intended for any of this to happen.”

Adding further tension between the various authorities involved, county prosecutor Bob McCulloch, who would be responsible for bringing any charges against the officer, reportedly reacted furiously to Nixon’s transfer of the policing of the demonstrations. “It’s shameful, what he did,” McCulloch {told the St Louis Post-Dispatch.}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/gov-nixon-gives-police-control-of-ferguson-situation-to-missouri/article_0806541b-ed48-5d06-9267-323531ad6cf1.html"">

Nixon declined to respond to McCulloch’s comments on Friday. “We’re focused on our responsibility we have here,” he said.

St Louis County police have a warrant for computer hard drives and video from the convenience store involved in the robbery.

More than a dozen officers, including Johnson, the highway patrol captain, visited the store on Friday afternoon and talked with staff.

Jay Kanzler, a lawyer for the owner, who was not named, told reporters that it was a customer, not a member of staff, who called police last Saturday. He said the store had been part of the community for many years and knew many customers by name – but not Brown.

Kanzler gave no details of the robbery and attempted to distance the store from the aftermath. He declined to say if staff even considered the incident a robbery.

“Another customer called the police. My clients were served with a warrant for the video and hard drives and will comply because they have to,” he said.

Ferguson police collected video footage last Saturday, said the lawyer. He did not know if St Louis County police would obtain additional material via the warrant. He said the store staff would make no statement and asked the media to leave them alone.”My clients have nothing to do with this investigation.”

Guardian,guard22,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/ferguson-michael-brown-unrest-reality-segregated-society,Missouri's days of unrest expose the stark reality of a segregated society,Rory Carroll; Jon Swaine,08/16/14,04/04/16,"The spectacle of American police acting like an occupying army in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson has shocked and baffled outsiders, but there was an explanation, of sorts, in a sleepy, tree-lined street just five minutes' walk from the mayhem.

Vickie Place is a row of single family homes built in the 1950s. They are modest but spacious, with gardens front and back, plenty of squirrels and a constant buzz from cicadas. The family of Michael Brown, {the unarmed 18-year-old African American gunned down by police last Saturday,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/st-louis-protesters-officer-teenager""> occupies a cream-coloured house with a peeling door, a broken bell and a tattered chair on the porch.

The teargas and screams from West Florissant Avenue, where mainly white police used military might to cow black protesters, did not reach Vickie Place, just a few blocks away. But a simple fact about the street, and those around it, sheds light on the police mindset: one by one, carload by carload, year by year, decade by decade, in an inexorable, remorseless exodus, white faces, faces like theirs, have vanished. The legacy, for the white officers supposed to police it, appears to be a forbidding, alien, territory. A land of the other. It might as well be Falluja.

On Saturday the governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew between midnight and 5am saying the state would not allow a ""handful of looters"" to endanger the community and that there must be calm if justice is to be served.

""The police don't like coming here,"" said Don Williams, 52, who moved to Vickie Place with his family in 2001. ""It was majority white then. Now, almost all black."" The absence of street lighting made everything pitch dark after sunset, intimidating patrols, he said. ""We have break-ins but the police barely investigate. They're not worth nothing."" Opposite the Brown home lives one of the street's last white residents, Doris McCann, who has lived here for 55 of her 86 years. ""It's a changed neighbourhood. Everyone that's white moved out,"" she lamented.

White flight is a familiar phenomenon in many countries but the use of armoured vehicles and sniper nests in the height of a {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> summer has exposed the extent and consequences of segregation in America's heartland.

For five nights, Saturday to Wednesday, the Ferguson city and St Louis county police departments betrayed hostility, incomprehension and fear as they confronted protesters, heedless that the militarised response had stoked anger and radicalism over Brown's death.

""I keep my sons shuttered at home because of situations like this. Young black men have targets painted on their backs,"" said Kesheara Ross, 26, a protester. ""I've had a cop call me nigger. This shit's been going on for years.""

Several factors contributed to the eruption. Brown, it emerged on Friday, had allegedly robbed a convenience store minutes before a police officer, Darren Wilson, apparently shot him several times as he ran away with his arms in the air.

With federal and local investigations under way, the killing's circumstances remained murky this weekend but there was widespread agreement that the police lost the plot during subsequent peaceful protests. It got so bad Palestinians in Gaza shared teargas tips with Ferguson's beleaguered protesters.

Many critics focused on the military equipment. Under a federal programme the Pentagon has offloaded $4.3bn in surplus gear, much of it from Afghanistan and Iraq, to police the US. As Kara Dansky, senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, pointed out, to a hammer everything looks like a nail.

Another factor was racial imbalance: only three of Ferguson's 53 officers are black (94% white, in other words) and only one of six city councillors is black – a product of disenfranchisement and anaemic political mobilisation in a city where two-thirds of the population is black.

Criticism from Barack Obama and protests across the US, including a rally in New York's Times Square, prompted Democratic state governor Jay Nixon to put Ron Johnson, a savvy African American captain of the highway patrol, a separate police force, in charge of Ferguson. It worked. On Thursday smiling black officers in uniform replaced the snipers and teargas. By Friday, when humid heat gave way to cool rain, protesters sang and danced. ""This is beautiful. It's what we've been wanting to do all week – make our voices heard,"" beamed Shelly Grandford, 34. But trouble resumed on Friday night when a small group broke away from a peaceful crowd to smash windows, throw bottles and loot the store Brown allegedly robbed, although it was a relatively minor confrontation. By Saturday morning calm had returned.

The sense that the worst had passed, however, masked an enduring problem: most of those in uniform inhabit a different realm to the people they are supposed to serve. {Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson alluded to this when he said there was ""a community that is at odds with us now"".}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/michael-brown-ferguson-murder-race-relations-white-police""> He added: ""Apparently there is this undertow that has now bubbled to the surface.""

Ferguson's mayor, James Knowles, who is also white, defended his police officers – the ones who waded in looking like Robocop on steroids. ""I'm sure they're under a great deal of stress, and though it does not make it OK, they are human, and I can understand their frustrations as well,"" Knowles said.

The union for St Louis county police was unrepentant about its members' actions before control was ceded to the highway patrol, defending ""the decisions made to control the unlawful and often chaotic moments of the previous days"". It said the move to a softer approach ""not only did not improve public safety but put officers' lives in danger"".

The separation of races should in theory be a fading anachronism given that a black man occupies the White House and black artists suffuse mainstream culture. But half a century after the civil rights movement triumphed, the dream of an integrated multiracial society in this sprawl by the Mississippi is largely dead. As black families moved to nicer areas, exploiting newfound freedom, white neighbours fled. ""It was gradual but they all packed up. You'll find them now in St Charles, Chesterfield, Wildwood, Alton,"" said McCann.

The new neighbours were friendly and respectful, but she missed the old days. ""It's 'how are you ma'am?' but we don't know each other, it's not neighbourly the way it used to be."" In contrast to her black neighbours, McCann had a benign view of the St Louis county police. ""In general I assume they do the best they can.""

Ron Goff, 67, a retired postman and perhaps the only other white resident of Vickie Place, had little sympathy for black motorists who cried racism when stopped and fined. ""Tyres gone, lights out, no insurance, pieces of junk, that's why.""

Goff said this during a conversation on the front lawn of his black neighbour and friend, Don Williams. Williams shook his head. To him it was obvious: when it came to the law black people did not get a fair shake. A Washington Post report found that of the black people stopped, 92% ended up arrested. Hence the joke about DWB: driving while black.

A recently arrived reporter for a local broadcaster said she had expected to find a melting pot in the city which had incubated Josephine Baker and Arthur Ashe, among others, only to discover that Delmar Boulevard {formed a demarcation line known to all:}<hyperlink=""http://www.wupr.org/2013/05/16/st-louis-a-segregated-city/""> north of it, 98% of the population is black (median income, $18,000); to the south, 73% white (median income, $50,000).

The alienation cuts both ways. In Ferguson many black residents believe only the worst about police, black or white. Johnson, the highway patrol captain, adroitly defused a tense gathering of youths. He shook hands, listened, engaged, flattered. Johnson was black and grew up in the area but represented a hostile, external force. The youths drifted away, peaceful but not placated. ""He may be ice, may be cool, but he's a cop,"" said their leader, who called himself Mike.

And then there are areas where they are expected to die. The shooting of a teenager in poor black neighborhoods often earns little more than a paragraph in the local paper. Beyond their communities, their passing prompts little more than a weary sigh. To exist as a working class African-American is to be vulnerable: to live in a poor, black area simply renders you collateral.

“By the numbers,” writes Jesmyn Ward {in Men We Reaped,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/06/men-we-reaped-jesmyn-ward""> “by all the official records, here at the confluence of history, of racism, of poverty and economic power, this is what our lives are worth: nothing.”

That the death of Michael Brown, the teenager from Ferguson, Missouri, who was shot dead last week, {and its ugly aftermath,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting""> should come in the year of the 50th anniversary of the passing of the Civil Rights Act, should give pause to the national orgy of self-congratulation. The law of the land has changed.

But the law of racial probabilities remains stubborn.

We have been told to be patient while we wait for the facts of Brown’s case to emerge. But facts are not in short supply.

We know that the military policing of black communities has been escalating for almost two generations.

“In 1972 there were just a few hundred paramilitary drug raids per year in the US,” writes Michelle Alexander, {in the New Jim Crow.}<hyperlink=""http://newjimcrow.com/""> “By the early 80’s there were three thousand annual Swat deployments, by 1996 there were thirty thousand, and by 2001 there were forty thousand.”

“You already know enough,” wrote Sven Lindqvist in Exterminate All the Brutes. “So do I. It is not knowledge we lack. What is missing is the courage to understand what we know and draw conclusions.”

The inevitable conclusion is that for all the symbolic ways in which America looks different racially when it comes to matters of substance, it acts the same.

When {Barack Obama}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama""> was contemplating a a presidential run, his sceptical wife, Michelle, asked him what he thought he could accomplish. “The day I take the oath of office,” he said. “The world will look at us differently. And millions of kids across this country will look at themselves differently. That alone is something.”

Many, donning rose-tinted glasses, declared themselves colour-blind and read racism its rights. “There is an old disease, and that disease is cured,” Bert Rein argued before the US supreme court, last year as he successfully persuaded them to gut the Voting Rights Act. “That problem is solved.”

But while America saw racism differently, it did not, apparently, see black people differently.

The racial inequality in unemployment and income {remained the same while disparities in wealth grew.}<hyperlink=""http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104552.html""> And there was the policing.

Which brings us to back Michael Brown. For he may well have seen himself differently when he watched Barack Obama take the oath or take a walk, that balmy November night of his presidential victory in 2012. He may have believed that he could ascend to the highest office or achieve his potential in whatever field he chose. But the police officer who shot Michael Brown did not assume he might be gunning down the future president of America. And so, like so many before him, he couldn’t even walk the streets.",566,1843,"America claims to see racism differently. But it does not, apparently, see black people differently",NA

Ferguson won't be the last flash point",Farai Chideya,08/17/14,04/04/16,"I spent my very early years in New York, living a very multiracial Sesame Street life, a big swinging bellbottom of a childhood. And then our family moved to Baltimore and the iron curtain of the ""colour line"" fell. I felt that I had moved from the 1970s through a time warp where black and white were the only two colours and never the twain shall socially meet.

I grew to understand what the 50s were actually like in Baltimore, when my mother, for example, was permitted to buy clothes from the major department store but not try them on. (Heaven forfend some black lady should be in the dressing room, right? You know they leave a residue of blackness on the clothes.)

America has never had one racial reality, but a series of them strung together from San Antonio to Pittsburgh to Appalachia. What we are seeing in {Ferguson, Missouri,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/obama-ferguson-police-excessive-force-michael-brown""> is the result of life in a specific type of heavily racialised zone. Yes, a city such as New York, where a black man was recently choked to death by police officers, has its own very clear forms of racialisation and it's a national issue. But the police killing, last week, of {Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality""> in Ferguson has sparked national protests because it represents a specific type of racialisation. This is of the majority black city, big or small, with a white economic and political power structure.

I grew up with {mayor William Donald Schaefer,}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/us/19schaefer.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0""> who presided over Baltimore from 1971-1987, an unusually long stretch. He was well-loved, but during those years the community I lived in – and the city at large – continued an era of white flight and educational inequality. Baltimore's black population was just 24% in 1950, then 46% in 1970, but during the Schaefer years it settled into life as a majority black city, with huge discrepancies in housing, income, and schooling.

Blacks pushed their way into some power in Baltimore, including the mayorality, but not so in Ferguson, Missouri. Between 1980 and 2010, Ferguson went from 14% black to 63% black. But Ferguson's mayor and police chief are white and few police officers and none of the members of the school board are black.

You cannot make up what happened in Ferguson. The case has been roiled by a perfect storm of ineptitude and exaggeration in response to legitimate protests, plus a dash of cyber-drama and an outpouring of national outrage. Some of that outrage is performative; much more is truly heartfelt and grassroots.

First, the police refused to name the officer in the shooting, changing their story about Brown's death. Subsequently, the force used rubber bullets and tear gas against protesters, with snipers aiming at the crowd. The decentralised ""hacktivist"" group Anonymous got involved, with one faction documenting protests across America, and another ""doxxed"" a man – revealed his identity as the shooter, an identity that was later shown to be wrong. Later still, the local police chief was removed as primary responder, but he still managed to muddy the waters (which the Brown family calls character assassination) by first releasing video of a black robber and then admitting it had nothing to do with Brown's shooting.

After the killing of another black youth, Trayvon Martin, Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote a seminal piece for Atlantic magazine called {""Fear of a Black President""}<hyperlink=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/09/fear-of-a-black-president/309064/"">, describing President Obama as ""conservative… in the very sphere where he holds singular gravity – race.""

Two years later, with Ferguson, the president still holds tight to that caution about addressing racial inequality. In terms of day-to-day Washington governance, there is no fear of a black president. Congress fears him not, certainly not the Republicans and not even some members of his own party. And now, with a particularly tepid and circular statement on Ferguson, the president has gone even further.

He seems obsessed with convincing white Americans he is not some goblin come to take their privilege away, rather than recognising that, pragmatically, America still has enough deeply held racial biases that he will be perceived as a race man by some, no matter what he does. (Black Americans learned his political strategy on race early in his first term, as a group of leaders of African American organisations came to ask for more White House focus on jobs in black communities and were rebuffed. They held their televised press conference outside the White House in a snowstorm, a nature-made bathetic fallacy.)

Last week, the president delivered a speech that seemed to weigh police intimidation and harassment of protesters and press with acts of vandalism almost equally. ""Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority,"" he said. ""Let's remember that we're all part of one American family.""

In this diffuse speech, the president could have spoken out more forcefully against the militarisation of local police forces, as Republican {Rand Paul}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/08/15/its-time-to-stop-calling-rand-paul-a-tea-partier/""> has done. He could have tackled the unacceptable level and variety of unwarranted stops, searches and frisking of black men in particular. For bonus points, he could have gotten into black incarceration rates or, as author Michelle Alexander puts it, the ""New Jim Crow"".

He could also have looked at Ferguson, and the way the typical majority-black city is kept – in racially specific ways as well as others – from the groaning table of American wealth and earnings. There's now a wealth gap of 20 to 1 between whites and blacks, a figure which doubled after the 2008 great recession.

The most offensive part of the current phase of the case is the release of the name of the officer who shot Brown timed with a video release of what may be Brown earlier that day committing a shoplifting robbery. Yet the police department stated that the officer involved in Brown's shooting knew nothing of the robbery. In any case, shoplifting is not supposed to be punishable by death. In a clip on CNN covering the Ferguson police chief's inarticulate press conference, the video of the robber constantly played behind the police chief's head. You don't have to be Rorschach to read the signs.

The changes of story are a maddening example of police obfuscation, racial bias in policing and how television news in particular often undercuts the stories with images that exacerbate racial stereotypes. It is an example of how far our country has to go to ensure the most basic conversations about race are not hijacked. And in the case of the president, it is an example of why a more concrete statement on race would have helped contextualise what is bound to be the latest flashpoint of race in America – but not the last.",315,479,The events in Missouri spring from America's deeply embedded segregation and black economic deprivation,NA
Guardian,guard25,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-michael-brown-shot-multiple-times-autopsy-shows-including-in-head,"Ferguson teenager Michael Brown felled by bullet to head, autopsy suggests",Rory Carroll; Jon Swaine; Chris Campbell,08/18/14,04/04/16,"Michael Brown, the unarmed teenager killed by a police officer in the Missouri city of Ferguson, was shot multiple times and finally felled by a mortal wound to the head, according to a preliminary autopsy and an account of the shooting provided by the officer, Darren Wilson.
The disclosures came on a night marred by shootings and clashes between protesters and police, the worst in eight days of turmoil, which terrified residents and left {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> resembling a war zone.
A violent altercation between protesters at around 9pm, which left a woman with a gunshot wound, triggered a swift response from police who had been preparing to enforce a curfew at midnight.

Officers fired multiple rounds of tear-gas and swept into the centre of Ferguson, prompting chaotic scenes as protesters and onlookers tried to flee. There were no immediate details about casualties.

Sunday’s revelation of an autopsy report of the 9 August killing, which has polarised opinion across the US, threatened to inflame tensions further. Brown, 18, was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, according to a preliminary private autopsy performed on behalf of his family on Sunday, {the New York Times reported.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=LedeSumLargeMedia&module=a-lede-package-region&region=lede-package&WT.nav=lede-package&_r=0"">
One of the bullets entered the top of the skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck and caused a fatal injury, according to Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner for the City of New York. He flew to Missouri at the family’s request to conduct the autopsy, which follows an earlier examination carried out for St Louis County, which is investigating the killing.

Baden said it was probably the last bullet to hit the teenager. Brown was also shot four times in the right arm. All bullets were fired into his front, the examiner concluded.
The absence of gunpowder on the body suggested the bullets were not fired from close range. That determination could change if there was gunshot residue on Brown’s clothing, to which Baden did not have access, he told the New York Times.

The autopsy’s revelaton that Brown was shot in the head mirrored Wilson’s account of the disputed incident, when he encountered Brown walking in the middle of a street in Ferguson with a friend, Dorian Johnson.

Wilson has not spoken publicly but a friend of the family, who declined to be named, told the Guardian that the officer admits he shot Brown in the head. However, his version of events contradicts aspects of the accounts given by some other eyewitnesses, including Dorian Johnson.

There appears to be little dispute that an altercation took place when Wilson encountered Brown and Johnson, shortly after a robbery at a convenience store. Brown then made off, but quickly turned back.

In Wilson’s version, Brown was moving towards the officer in a threatening manner when he was shot. The autopsy concludes that all the shots were fired from the front.

Wilson’s account is that Brown continued to move towards him even after the first shots were fired, and did not stop until suffering a mortal wound to the head. “He just kept coming,” the friend said, characterising Wilson’s account.

The Department of Justice, which is leading a civil-rights investigation into the killing, on Sunday took the unusual step of ordering a federal medical examiner to conduct a third autopsy on Brown’s body. A spokesman for Eric Holder, the attorney general, cited the “extraordinary circumstances” of the case for the decision.

Both sides in what is becoming an increasingly incendiary and politicised story are likely to offer different interpretations: that Wilson fired in self-defence; or that six bullets showed excessive force.
Friends of Wilson and his girlfriend, Barbara Spradling, also a Ferguson police officer, have expressed concern about the racial and institutional politics involved, worrying that the charged environment may unduly influence the case.
In addition to concerns for their safety, friends of Spradling and Wilson believe his reputation has been unfairly tarnished by a rush to judgment from the media and some members of the public.
One friend of Spradling believes the legitimacy of any evidence supporting Wilson’s version of events will be questioned by protesters.
Sunday night’s mayhem further poisoned the toxic relationship between police and Ferguson residents. It also raise urgent questions about Governor Jay Nixon’s decision on Saturday to declare a state of emergency and impose a midnight-to-5am curfew.
A coalition of civil rights groups condemned the move. The American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Legal Defense and Education Fund and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law said the order violated the constitutional right to free assembly.
The order fell short of legal requirements to define the area affected by the curfew, the groups said. “People have a right to know when and where their conduct is lawful under all circumstances, but especially when the government is restricting activities that are protected by the first amendment,” their statement read. “Restricting this most fundamental of all American values is not a solution to the problems in Ferguson.”
In St Louis, {a crowd of about 150 people gathered in support of Wilson.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-supporters-police-killed-teenager-protest""> Some wielded placards with messages defending the 28-year-old officer and his family, during the early-evening demonstration.
“He was doing his job,” said Kaycee Reinisch, 57, of Lincoln County, Missouri. “And now because of public uproar in Ferguson, he is being victimised. He is being victimised by the whole city, the state and the federal government.” Reinisch said she had relations in law enforcement who would be “frightened to do their jobs” if Wilson were punished for the incident.
Earlier on Sunday Brown’s parents held a memorial service for their son at the Greater Grace Church. The veteran civil rights leader Al Sharpton told the packed congregation that the response to the death was a crucial test for US policing. “This is the defining moment in this country. All over the world, the debate is how the rights of people are dealt with by the state,” he said.",839,1681,"• Brown hit by multiple shots, all fired from the front

“I’m a soldier, I’m a military officer and I know when there’s a need for such thing, but I don’t think in a small town of 22,000 people you need up-armor vehicles,” Cristian Balan, a communications officer in the US army, who was not speaking on behalf of the {US military,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military""> told the Guardian. “Even if there’s an active shooter – are you really going to use an up-armor vehicle? Do you really need it?”

In the eyes of the government, the answer increasingly seems to be a resounding yes.

Since 2006, state and local law enforcement have acquired at least 435 armored vehicles, 533 military aircraft and 93,763 machine guns, {according to an investigation by the New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/war-gear-flows-to-police-departments.html?_r=1""> published in June. This was made possible under a department of defense program that allows the agency to transfer excess military property to US law enforcement agencies. More than $4.3bn worth of gear has been transferred since the program was created in 1997, {according to the Law Enforcement Support Office}<hyperlink=""http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/pages/default.aspx""> (LESO).

The ACLU said there are no “meaningful constraints” to what a local police force could acquire, meaning that even a 10,000 person town with no history of major violence could request and receive a mine-resistant vehicle, like those that {are currently available on the LESO site.}<hyperlink=""www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/leso/Pages/Vehicles.aspx"">

Forced to address the issue at a Pentagon briefing on Thursday, spokesman Read Admiral John Kirby said that while the government made such equipment available in a “useful” program, it was up to local agencies to decide how to use it. “I’m not going to inject the Pentagon into this discussion,” he said. “How this equipment is used to serve local citizens is up for local law enforcement agencies to speak to.”

The increasing militarization of US police is also attributed to the skyrocketing proliferation of Swat teams across the US. There has been a more than 1400% increase in the amount of Swat deployments between 1980 and 2000, {according to estimates (pdf) by}<hyperlink=""http://cjmasters.eku.edu/sites/cjmasters.eku.edu/files/21stmilitarization.pdf""> Eastern Kentucky University professor Peter Kraska.

The police presence in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> has centred around two large armoured trucks ferrying around officers in military-style uniforms. Officers wearing body armour and holding sniper-style rifles have been positioned atop them. Some have adorned night-vision goggles as the evenings grew darker.

Accompanying the trucks have been hundreds of officers from various forces from around the region. Some state troopers and county police officers have been kitted out in basic riot gear – shields, batons and helmets with visors – along with their standard handguns and plastic cuffs.

Others, whose affiliations are not made clear by their uniform, have been carrying what look like AR-15 assault rifles. They wear helmets and all-black body armour, some with partial urban camouflage.

On Wednesday evening, some such officers were carrying 12-gauge shotguns and {“super-sock” bean-bag cartridges}<hyperlink=""http://www.officerstore.com/store/product.aspx/productId/18425/CTS-12ga-Super-Sock-Bean-Bag-Impact-Round-Box-of-5/""> for shooting at protesters.

But the most alarming sight for many protesters and residents has been the deployment of officers wearing army-style fatigues distinguished only from the military version by the word “POLICE” emblazoned in grey across their chest. Some have been carrying grenade launchers,apparently for shooting gas canisters. The remains of {“triple chaser”}<hyperlink=""http://www.safariland.com/products/less-lethal/chemical-agent-devices/chemical-grenades/pyrotechnic/triple-chaser/triple-chaser-separating-canister-cn-1012307.html""> {grenades}<hyperlink=""http://www.safariland.com/products/less-lethal/chemical-agent-devices/chemical-grenades/pyrotechnic/triple-chaser/triple-chaser-separating-canister-cn-1012307.html""> have been found on the streets. Others have carried paintball-style guns for shooting pepperballs.

“As we’ve seen in Ferguson, the militarization of policing tends to escalate the risk of violence to the communities,”said Kara Dansky, senior counsel with the ACLU’s Center for Justice and the prime author of its June 2014 {report on the militarization of US police.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/24/military-us-police-swat-teams-raids-aclu""> “We think that historically, the police and the military have had different roles and that American neighborhoods aren’t war zones and police officers should not be treating us like wartime enemies.”

On Monday night unrest flared again, with police returning to the use of teargas and stun grenades against protesters, according to reports. Media were being ordered to stay behind a police-designated cordon as the latest confrontations unfolded:

[tweetbegin 501594496778637312 tweetend]

Missouri governor Jay Nixon earlier announced the decision to deploy the national guard to {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> after the worst night of violence since a police officer shot dead an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, on 9 August. It is the first time that the national guard has been deployed to quell civil unrest in the United States since the 1992 race riots in Los Angeles.

Speaking from the White House, Obama called for a review of the use of military equipment by local police forces, warning that a continued blurring of the lines between military and local law enforcement would be “contrary to our traditions”.

Governor Nixon, struggling to find an effective response to the protests that have rocked Ferguson for more than a week, has abandoned a controversial and ineffective curfew that failed to prevent violence.

In anticipation of the first night of national guard deployment, police in Ferguson enforced sharply different tactics through the afternoon on West Florissant Avenue, the street where most clashes have taken place.

For several days, crowds and cars were allowed by Captain Ron Johnson, the {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> highway state patrol officer placed in charge of policing the protests, to build steadily through the afternoon. The strategy left hundreds of people poised for confrontation as a midnight curfew approached.

But on Monday, county police officers were ordering people to keep moving and barring them from congregating around the burned out QuikTrip convenience store that has been a base for many protesters. Two people were arrested, apparently for unlawful assembly, outside a McDonald’s that was badly vandalised on Sunday night.

As the evening approached, a county police spokesman announced in a statement that an “organised protest zone” would be established close to the convenience store where Michael Brown allegedly stole cigars minutes before he died.

[tweetbegin 501493445874425856 tweetend]

Traffic would be blocked from West Florissant by 5pm, said the spokesman, Brian Schellman, preventing access for protesters who on recent nights have repeatedly driven up and down the street with passengers hanging out of windows or sitting on the roof.

In Washington, Obama struck a more detached tone over the root causes of violence. He acknowledged the feelings of alienation felt by many young African Americans in the US: “In too many communities around this country young men of color are left behind and seen as objects of fear,” he said. But he also accused some protestors of “stirring chaos” and declined to answer whether he would be visiting the city himself.

“While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos,” said the president in a White House address that interrupted his two-week vacation. “It undermines rather than advanc[es] justice.”

Earlier on Monday, it was revealed that the White House had not been given advance warning of governor Jay Nixon’s decision to {call out the Missouri national guard,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-michael-brown-national-guard-deployed""> something Obama did not deny when asked about the deployment.

“I spoke to Jay Nixon about this, expressed an interest in making sure that if in fact the national guard is used, it is used in a limited and appropriate way,” said the president. “He described the support role that they’re going to be providing to local law enforcement. And I’ll be watching over the next several days, to assess whether, in fact, it’s helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson.”

A heavy-handed police response in the first few days of demonstrations has been widely criticised in Washington, where some lawmakers are proposing legislation to limit a federal scheme that has been used to distribute surplus military equipment to civil police departments.

“I think it’s probably useful for us to review how the funding has gone, how local law enforcement has used grant dollars, to make sure that what they’re – what they’re purchasing is stuff that they actually need,” said Obama. “Because, you know, there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don’t want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our traditions.”

But, other than announcing that Holder would be visiting Ferguson on Wednesday, there was little new intervention by the administration in the handling of the crisis.

Unlike his response to the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, Obama has been reluctant to take sides in the dispute over the police shooting of Michael Brown – perhaps wary of further polarising the national debate or appearing to condone the violent reaction.

“I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed,” said Obama.

Holder acknowledged the frustrations felt by protesters about the lack of information about the investigations. “I realise there is tremendous interest in the facts of the incident that led to Michael Brown’s death, but I ask for the public’s patience as we conduct this investigation,” {Holder said in a statement}<hyperlink=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-statement-latest-developments-federal-civil-rights-investigation-ferguson-mo""> after meeting Obama.

In Ferguson, attorneys for Brown’s family claimed that the findings of a private autopsy indicated that he was killed while trying to surrender.

Brown was shot “at least” six times by officer Darren Wilson and was ultimately killed by a bullet that entered the top of his head and travelled “back to front”, attorney Daryl Parks said the autopsy had found, arguing this showed Brown was fatally shot when his head was well bowed.

Dr Michael Baden, who carried out the autopsy, said that “there weren’t signs of a struggle” on Brown’s body. Police have said that Brown assaulted Wilson after the officer stopped him and a friend and told them to walk on the sidewalk rather than in the road on 9 August.

However Baden, the former chief medical examiner for New York City, was more cautious than the lawyers, stating that the findings in his preliminary report “could be consistent” with suggestions that Brown had been shot while charging at Wilson. “It’s possible,” he said.

“There are many different witness testimonies,” said Baden. “Many seem to line up in one direction, some in another direction. Right now until we get more information we can’t, from a forensic science point of view, can’t distinguish and can’t make an absolute judgment.”",NA,191,"• Eric Holder will review Michael Brown death investigation

Olson said he was “arrested for just doing my job.” As with previous arrests of journalists, no charges were filed against Olson, who by Monday night was back shooting photos.

Police in Ferguson had been preventing crowds from gathering on the streets in Ferguson on Monday.

An “organised protest zone” was set up close to the convenience store where unarmed teenager Michael Brown allegedly stole cigars minutes before he was shot by a police officer. Media were directed to view the zone from another area opposite it. Olson was across the street from the press area when he was detained.

Pancho Bernasconi, vice-president for news at Getty Images, said before his release: “Getty Images staff photographer Scott Olson was arrested this afternoon in Ferguson, Missouri, while on assignment documenting the events there. We at Getty Images stand firmly behind our colleague Scott Olson and the right to report from Ferguson. Getty Images is working to secure his release as soon as possible.

“We strongly object to his arrest and are committed to ensuring he is able to resume his important work of capturing some of the most iconic images of this news story.”

Barack Obama condemned the arrest of journalists in Ferguson last week. “Police should not be bullying or arresting journalists just trying to do their jobs,” he said then.

Authorities in Ferguson later signed a court declaration pledging not to arrest journalists covering the protests, unless they posed a threat to public safety or were obstructing police.

It’s not like the “best” stores of Ferguson – the McDonald’s or the Walgreen’s, for instance – provide much more than minimum wage jobs, barely helpful for subsistence living. The dollar stores pedaling cheap goods and unhealthy food that no one needs aren’t much better. And it’s undeniable that the worst of Ferguson’s businesses – the many legal loan sharks who blight its streets – are actively strangling the last breaths from Ferguson’s black residents who are already on the margins.

On Thursday evening it melted away.

A carnival-like demonstration filled the centre of the city after a new police chief given control of protests over the killing of an unarmed 18-year-old implemented a dramatic shift in tactics.

Hundreds of people gathered at the same intersection in this northern suburb of St Louis that has been the epicentre of violent clashes with police in the previous days.

But where the officers with assault rifles once stood, backed by armoured trucks topped with snipers’ nests, on Thursday there was almost no police presence.

Car horns filled the air as people blew whistles and chanted “no justice, no peace” and “hands up, don’t shoot”, the slogan adopted in solidarity with Michael Brown, who according to witnesses was shot by a police officer as he fled a confrontation with his arms aloft on Saturday afternoon.

The shift followed the installation of Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri state highway patrol as the effective commander on the ground, under {orders earlier in the day from the state governor, Jay Nixon.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/obama-ferguson-police-excessive-force-michael-brown""> His force replaced the St Louis county police in leading the operation.

“I think they are just being given a chance to express what they are feeling, and they don’t feel like that is trying to be taken away,” Johnson told the Guardian, as he kept watch while the demonstration formed. “That’s our approach, and that’s what we’re going to continue to do.

“Sometimes you just have to let people speak and make yourself listen. I used to tell my kids when they were small, open up your listening ears.”

Johnson briefly led a march of demonstrators through the city, saying he was proud to walk with the largely African American crowd.

Residents have said Brown’s killing stoked racial tensions that have long simmered between the majority black population and the mostly white police force. Asked how he was managing to get his message through to demonstrators, Johnson said: “I know a lot of them”. He added: “We have to be reflective of our community.”

“It’s just so different, said Rena Perry, 33. “The other nights the police were over there and we was over here. It was a war. This new guy has changed the atmosphere.”

Speaking at a press conference earlier, Johnson refused to rule out using the military-style equipment that drew sharp criticism from the state’s senior senator, Claire McCaskill, and a plea for calm from Barack Obama, who said there was “no excuse” for excessive force by police.

However he signalled his intent was to rid Ferguson’s streets of the teargas, rubber bullets and pepperballs that have been shot at dozens of demonstrators this week. “Before I came here today, I had all my troopers take their teargas masks off their belts,” he told reporters.

As evening began several of the few police officers who were present were chatting with demonstrators and residents – an unthinkable sight over the past four nights.

“We appreciate them being out here,” said Major Ronnie Robinson. “They are seeking justice and that’s what they’re going to get.

“Any time a community and a people are willing to break the law to get the law, you’ve gotta pay attention to that,” said Robinson. “They have cried out to us and now we need to give them the attention they deserve.”

Some remained unconvinced. A small group of young men wearing matching red bandanas across their faces and St Louis Cardinals baseball caps pledged to continue clashing with police and rejected the change in tone.

“It doesn’t matter that the dude has a black face,” said Kloud, 25. “They’re all cops.” However the majority of people expressed cautious optimism that the peace could hold as calm reigned at 8.30pm.",396,6285,Crowds respond positively after county police who used teargas and rubber bullets are replaced on governor’s orders,NA

People I know faced down police dogs to participate in a peaceful protest outside of the Ferguson police department on Saturday. A friend spent hours trying to help young people get home Monday night after buses stopped running – and she ended up letting several stay overnight for fear that they may be targeted for violence if they remained outside. Major cleanup efforts are scheduled for Wednesday.

Ferguson is not a war zone and residents are not enemy combatants – but that’s what it looked like the last few nights.

I am not condoning violence or looting, but the anger and frustration being voiced by people in Ferguson comes from a very real place. At least one {witness account}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> of Brown’s killing – that the police approached him and demanded that he stop walking in the street – raises grave concerns in a community where there are valid concerns about racial profiling by a mostly white police force.

That was the social climate when Ferguson residents were confronted by police officers Monday night, officers who were brandishing weapons and handling police dogs, some of whom shouted at residents to go home. Some residents responded by saying, simply: I am home.

Ferguson might not be our home, either, but it borders my city and is part of our regional community. So my sister and I attended a mass community meeting organized by the St Louis County NAACP near Ferguson on Monday night, at which over 1,000 people showed up. They came from all over the region, and there were so many people that they overflowed into the parking lot.

When it became apparent that the crowd was not going to be allowed into the building and people seemed to be getting restless, a young woman worked her way to the front of the crowd. She raised her voice and reminded the frustrated crowd that we all showed up because we want to address the violence and oppression that fueled that past four days of unrest. The crowd of over 200 people then formed a circle, held hands and we recited the Lord’s Prayer.

By the time the mass meeting ended, thousands of people in Ferguson were already huddled in their homes, and platoons of police officers marched down tree-lined streets pointing weapons into backyards.

Some people at Monday’s mass meeting called for a forum to open up a community dialogue. The optimist in me hopes that happens, but for any dialogue to have an impact it will need to have diverse participation. We can’t move forward if the only people talking about change are black people and liberal allies. Fruitful dialogue will involve diverse participation from the St Louis region, including members of law enforcement, the faith community, educators, healthcare providers and residents. We need to start talking about the larger issues fueling racial tension – we need to talk about more than just Mike Brown.

The tragic events of the past few days could be the beginning of something. Our communities are not war zones. Residents and business owners in Ferguson have been subjected to unimaginable oppression, but we need to build a path toward reconciliation.

Jay Nixon handed responsibility for law and order to the Missouri state highway patrol, led by an African American captain raised in the town at the heart of four nights of violent confrontation since the shooting of Michael Brown by police on Saturday.

On Thursday night the change appeared to be paying dividends — {tensions were melting away and an almost festive atmosphere broke out,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/ferguson-disarming-tactics-of-highway-patrol-pay-dividends-as-calm-descends""> with police stopping to chat with demonstrators and residents.

“We all have been concerned about the vision that the world has seen,” Nixon said. He admitted that {Ferguson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> a suburb of St Louis had, come to resemble a “war zone”.

Promising a “softer front”, Nixon said that a new command would ensure that “we allow peaceful and appropriate protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit”.

But Nixon declined to rule out the use, if necessary, of the military equipment deployed so controversially on Ferguson’s streets this week.

Ronald Johnson, captain of the highway patrol, signalled a different tone. He told reporters: “Before I came here today, I had all my troopers take their teargas masks off their belts”. Johnson promised a new approach and said he would visit the torched QwikStop gas station “that has been called Ground Zero” to talk to people.

Nixon said that St Louis county police, although removed from the front line, would continue to lead the investigation into Brown’s death. He added that the name of the officer who shot the 18-year old dead, for which the campaigners filed a lawsuit on Thursday, should be released “expeditiously as possible”.

Speaking from Martha’s Vineyard, where he is on vacation, Obama said that while looting and violence against law enforcement officials was unacceptable, there was “no excuse” for police to use excessive force in response.

“We lost a young man in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances,” Obama said. “He was 18 years old and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again.”

Appealing for restraint, he added: “Now’s the time for healing, now’s the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.” 

Obama’s comments came after a fourth night of confrontation in Ferguson, where residents of the majority black town of 21,000 people have been protesting against the killing of Brown by an officer from the overwhelmingly white police force.

The response to the protest had been led by the St Louis County police force, which has deployed snipers, armoured vehicles and officers in military combat gear to quell protests on successive evenings since Brown’s death on Saturday. Two reporters, with the Washington Post and the Huffington Post, were arrested on Wednesday night.

Obama condemned the arrest of reporters. “Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs.”

The senior US senator for Missouri, Claire McCaskill, said she had been working to “demilitarise” the situation. She said on Thursday: “This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution. I obviously respect law enforcement’s work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect that right and protect that right. Today is going to be a new start, we can and need to do better.”

Heavily armed police officers from various forces fired gas canisters, rubber bullets and pepper balls at hundreds of young, predominantly African American protesters for several hours on Wednesday night after bottles were thrown at them from a largely peaceful protest.

The crowd had gathered in the centre of Ferguson, a suburb north of St Louis, to again demonstrate their fury at the shooting of Brown last Saturday. Police say that Brown was shot after assaulting the officer, but a friend who was walking with him, and witnesses to the shooting, say that he was shot repeatedly while attempting to run away from the struggle.

The officer, a member of the 53-strong Ferguson city force, has not been named and the police have declined to offer a detailed timeline of what happened. The lack of information being made public has seemed only to inflame the protests.

Several members of the crowds who fled Ferguson to escape the crackdown, a city with a population that is two-thirds black, told the Guardian on Wednesday night that they felt under fire from a militarised and almost unanimously white police force.

However, the city force was defended by mayor James Knowles, who said that they were “under a great deal of stress” and dealing with “a lot of unlawfulness”.

“I can’t second-guess these officers,” Knowles told MSNBC. “They are the professionals. They have learned from many years of dealing with these incidents across the nation. We’re just going to have to try our best to maintain order, and we ask the citizens to help us comply with that.”

Responding to criticism of the police tactics, Brian Schellman, a spokesman for St Louis County police, said on Thursday that commanders on the ground had authorised “whatever force was necessary for the situation”.

“Luckily for both sides, there’s been no lethal force used,” Schellman told the Guardian. “But what has been used is things like molotov cocktails. Those are deadly weapons. So the police response to the molotov cocktails was less lethal munitions. We’re not using deadly force when a deadly force molotov cocktail was used on us.”

Schellman could not confirm that any molotov cocktails or bottles had actually struck any officers. “But does that make it OK for people to throw? I don’t know,” he said. “To me it doesn’t. It doesn’t make it OK. To say ‘It doesn’t really matter because they didn’t hurt any of the officers’, we can’t think like that.

“So, do we have to wait until one of our officers gets hurt? That’s the big question here.” Asked if he meant that the answer was “No,” Schellman said: “Absolutely.” Speaking late on Wednesday night at the police command centre, Schellman said officers had used “as much restraint as we could given the situation”, adding: “We have not had any violent uses of force ... no gunshots, no using batons in an aggressive manor, and no civilians injured.”

There was growing anger on Thursday at the arrest of two journalists, detained as they were working in a McDonald’s near the scene of the protests.

“That behavior was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news,” {said Washington Post executive editor Martin Baron}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/statement-from-martin-d-baron-on-the-arrest-of-wesley-lowery/2014/08/13/a8dd6e66-235f-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html""> about the arrest of reporter Wesley Lowery. “We are appalled by the conduct of police officers involved.”

The Huffington Post called the arrests, including that of its reporter Ryan Reilly, the result of police militarization that is “now beginning to affect press freedom”.

The reporters were seen being loaded into an unmarked police van. They were later released without charge, apparently after the intervention of the Ferguson police chief.

Most of Ferguson’s children are African American, which {automatically makes them, particularly the boys, suspect.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/mike-brown-ferguson-shooting-police-black""> The weight on their small shoulders that they must be up to something is heavier now than it already was 10 days ago, before the unarmed, 18-year-old Brown was killed.

Amor and Tavier’s mother is Shonta Jones, who has three other sons between the ages of three and 16. Like any parent, she wants to protect her boys from knowing too much about violence – but she is distinctly aware that a boys will be boys attitude is not a luxury her sons can afford. Her sons have to earn their innocence in Ferguson, but it comes at the expense of letting go of the assumptions of childhood at a very young age.

Her 10-year-old, Antonio, for instance, didn’t used to fear the police. “One time, a couple people stole our bikes and scooter,” he told me, and the police “came and got out stuff back. So I was happy with them.”

But after Trayvon Martin’s violent death (while wearing a hooded sweatshirt) and now Brown’s, he fears for his older brother, Taujh:

""I was afraid when they killed [Brown]. I was scared about my big brother, Taujh, ’cuz he’s around 18. So I was kind of scared for him because he wears hoodies and stuff.""

Taujh, 16, said he had been far less concerned about being racially profiled than his brothers or mother are for him. A couple weeks ago, he told me, he’d found the cops to be “nice and funny.” But now, “with the riots, I don’t want to be accused of anything,” he said. “So I stay in front of my house.”

“As of right now”, he said, “I don’t trust [the police] at all.”

It was more than just Brown’s death that changed Taujh’s mind: like his 11-year-old brother Tavier, it was seeing a militarized police force turned on his town.

""That made me not trust them, either. I heard people were just protesting peacefully, or whatever. They started using teargas on them. I saw a picture of a woman, a white woman, she had a big wound on her stomach from a rubber bullet. That made me not trust them. I play a lot of games. I saw a picture of a man, a sniper on a roof, like Call of Duty or Battlefield. I thought it was from a game! ... But it was real. And I thought, ‘This isn’t Iraq, this is Ferguson!’ I said, ‘That’s messed up.’ … What’s the point of bringing a tank? Are you going to blow up everybody? That’s not necessary.""

Tavier added, “I think [the police are] not scary, but they make me nervous”, noting that, during the protests, officers “were shooting with rubber bullets, and a woman got shot in the stomach. And Mike Brown got shot.” 

Still, Tavier says he would call the police if he was in trouble. “I would tell them what’s going on,” he says, adding with downcast eyes, “If I see them, I wouldn’t run.”

His 10-year-old brother, Antonio, is less sanguine after seeing where Brown was shot: “I thought, if I call the police, and they thought I was the person that did whatever I had called [about], they might shoot me or tase me.”

I, too, spent some time where Brown was shot and saw Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s grieving mother. She was surrounded by women who gently gave her hugs as she shuffled along the sidewalk like a ghost, looking only half alive.

Shonta Jones can too easily imagine being in McSpadden’s shoes, and told her oldest, Taujh, that “Mike Brown could have been you, and it hurt my soul.” Jones is terrified of the double standard on display when the police deal with people who look like her son: “Even if [Brown] stole cigarettes it wasn’t worth killing him,” she said, adding “even the guy who shot up the movie theater didn’t have to lose his life.”

Unlike her sons, Jones never liked or trusted the Ferguson police, particular the way they’ve treated her when she’s been pulled over in her SUV. But it’s even worse, she says, when “you see a black man pulled over, and you see they’ve got him down on the curb. You see a white person pulled over, and they’re standing freely or still in their car.”

“I feel like we were treated very poorly when it came to our rights,” she says. “They are taking away protesting because there were too many black people speaking up in one place.”

After I interviewed Jones and her sons, I spoke with the Reverend Jesse Jackson here and asked him what he thought of Jones’s fears for her five boys.

“Those concerns are real” in {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> and all over the nation, Jackson told me. “My boys have been profiled,” he added, before ticking off a list of deaths of young black men at the hands of the police around the country. For these five brothers in Ferguson, the news has meant having to grapple with these same violent current events at their much younger ages.

Tavier, the second-oldest in the family, has already had {“the talk”}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/14/ferguson-occupation-peace-calm""> with his dad about how to manage police harassment. But at 11, his takeaway was that his dad wanted him to “see how the police are thinking, [so] I know not to get dreads” to better coming avoid suspicion. Taujh, the oldest, told me initially that he’s not worried: “I’m not bragging, but I’m an all-around good kid.”

But after listening to his mother and brothers, he owned up to his mistrust of the cops and said, “It was good to get that off my chest.”

Still, whether Tavier, Antonio, Taujh, Amor and three-year-old Zion are “good kids” or not might not matter in Ferguson – or anywhere else in America. And after the protests are over and the politicians look away, if nothing has changed, these boys will still live their lives under a cloud of suspicion.

“That’s the real violence,” as Jesse Jackson put it: when children live in neighborhoods devoid of opportunity, under an assumption of guilt which robs them of the presumption of innocence and dims their view of what may be possible in their world and their lives. The status quo is as dangerous as the events of the last week for children in places like Ferguson. If that isn’t challenged once the teargas clears, this loss of light in kids like these will be even more of a tragedy.",200,611,How will five black brothers ever trust the police or this violent city ever again?

“You mad and you angry and you have every right to be,” Sharpton said during a rally held by his National Action Network in {New York.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york""> “But because you can’t control your anger, they’ll use your lack of control to control the process to rob [Brown’s family] of justice.

“They want us to lose our minds so we can lose the cases.”

The National Action Network is holding back-to-back rallies in New York and Missouri over the weekend, to demand justice for two African-American men killed by police: {Eric Garner,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/eric-garner-protest-march-moved-bridge-staten-island""> a 43-year-old Staten Island man {who died last month}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/02/campaigners-nypd-officer-charges-eric-garner-homicide""> after being put in an illegal chokehold by an NYPD officer, and Brown, 18, who was fatally shot {last Saturday.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/police-fatal-shooting-black-teenager-angry-crowd-st-louis-suburb"">

Sharpton was joined at the rally by Garner’s family and the US representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York.

Sharpton questioned the decision by police in Ferguson to release surveillance footage that allegedly showed Brown stealing cigars from a convenience store shortly before he was shot. Police on Friday gave {conflicting accounts}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/ferguson-police-michael-brown-robbery-suspect""> of whether the two events were connected.

“You put [the video] out because you wanted to smear the name of the victim and there’s nothing more contemptible and offensive to the people of this country than for law enforcement to try to smear a dead man or dead child that can’t speak for themselves,” Sharpton said. “… Like that in any way mitigates what was done to him.”

Sharpton said police tried to taint Garner’s image after his death by quickly releasing his arrest record.

Garner was being taken into custody for selling untaxed cigarettes, known as “loosies”, when an officer put him in a chokehold and refused to let up, even as he gasped: “I can’t breathe.” He had been arrested more than 30 times.

Sharpton said: “Both of them were victims of this aggressive policing of alleged low-level crimes and you cannot have a nation where people lose their lives because [of this].”

Sharpton called the “broken windows” crime-fighting strategy, which calls for tough enforcement of punishments for low-level crimes to stop offenders from committing more serious ones in the future, “racist”, and said it unfairly and disproportionately targets minority communities like the ones in which Garner and Brown lived.

Jeffries, who represents the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, repeated his request that the US Department of Justice take over the investigation into Garner’s death. He said state courts too often fail to convict police officers.

Jeffries said: “Eric Garner is dead. The person who videotaped the incident was arrested. But the officer who killed Eric Garner is free and still on the NYPD payroll. There’s something wrong with that picture.”

Jeffries is part of a six-member congressional delegation which sent a letter to the attorney general, Eric Holder, asking him to open investigations into Garner’s death as well as the “broken windows” strategy.

Garner’s widow and mother spoke briefly at the end of the rally, encouraging New Yorkers to join the march being held in his name next Saturday.

Sharpton said protesters will march from the site on Staten Island where Garner was killed to the district attorney’s office, where they will ask that the case be handed over to federal investigators.

“We need everybody to come out and support this march because it’s not only for my son,” said Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr.

Wilson and his girlfriend, Barbara Spradling, left their home in Crestwood, a predominantly white neighbourhood some 18 miles from Ferguson, before {he was named}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/ferguson-police-darren-wilson-michael-brown-shooting""> last week in connection with the shooting of Michael Brown.

But before they left, Spradling gave an account of the shooting to a friend, who says it is markedly different from the narrative espoused by Brown’s family and their supporters.

The friend of Spradling’s, who declined to be named, told the Guardian that Wilson admits that he shot Brown in the head, as confirmed by an independent autopsy performed at the family’s request, {the results of which}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?_r=0""> were first reported by the New York Times on Sunday.

However, Wilson’s version of events, as told through Spradling to the friend, contradicts aspects of the accounts given by some other eyewitnesses, including Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown who was with him when he was stopped, minutes after the pair were allegedly involved in a robbery at a convenience store.

There appears to be little dispute that a struggle took place, though the pathologists who carried out the autopsy for Brown’s family said Monday their preliminary finding was that Brown’s body showed no evidence of one. The account provided by police, given in the hours after the shooting, is that Wilson stopped Brown and Johnson for walking down the middle of the street when they should have been on the sidewalk.

Spradling told the friend who spoke to the Guardian that Brown initiated the altercation by striking Wilson in the face, leading to a struggle for Wilson’s gun that resulted in one shot being fired in the police vehicle.

St Louis County police chief Jon Belmar {said at a news conference on Sunday}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/police-fatal-shooting-black-teenager-angry-crowd-st-louis-suburb""> that when Wilson got out of his squad car, Brown pushed him back in, and a struggle ensued. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer’s gun inside the police car. An officer with the St Louis County police, who declined to be named, told the Guardian that Brown sustained an injury to his thumb at this point; the autopsy released on Monday shows that one shot hit Brown’s hand.

Johnson has given several slightly differing accounts of the incident. A week ago he {told MSNBC}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> that as a squad car pulled up, Wilson called out at them to “get the fuck on the sidewalk”, before the car reversed back alongside them. Johnson claims the officer opened his door onto Brown, and the door bounced off him.

Johnson, {in an account supported by other eyewitnesses,}<hyperlink=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2725057/New-witnesses-claim-Michael-Brown-did-wrong-cop-shooting-Missouri.html""> maintains that Wilson grabbed Brown through the window of his squad car. Johnson, in a disputed claim, said that Wilson fired a shot while still grabbing on to Brown.

What is not disputed is that Brown then made off. In his MSNBC interview, Johnson said Brown was shot in the back, at which point he turned around and put his hands up. “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting,” Brown said, according to Johnson. (Johnson’s assertion that Brown was shot in the back was not supported by the findings of the independent autopsy.)

But Spradling told the friend that Brown turned around after the officer called on him to stop. In Wilson’s version, Brown was not shot while surrendering, but while moving toward Wilson in a threatening manner. Brown reportedly continued to move toward Wilson even after being shot, and did not stop moving forward until suffering a mortal wound to the head.

“He just kept coming,” the friend said Wilson claimed.

In Wilson’s account, Brown never raised his hands to plead for his life, or said “don’t shoot”, but rather taunted Wilson before moving forward and being shot.

Spradling told the friend the prevailing narrative was “a lie” before going into seclusion.

Friends of the couple have also expressed concern about the racial and institutional politics involved, worrying that the charged environment may unduly influence the case. In addition to concerns for their safety, friends of Spradling and Wilson believe Wilson’s reputation has been unfairly tarnished by a rush to judgment from the media and some members of the public. One friend of Spradling’s believes the legitimacy of any evidence supporting Wilson’s version of events will be questioned by protesters.",NA,402,"Darren Wilson’s version of events, as told through his girlfriend to a friend, contradicts aspects of other eyewitness accounts",NA

The tensions erupted after a candlelight vigil Sunday night for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday after a scuffle involving the officer, Brown and another person in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb of the city.

Several businesses near the shooting scene were looted, including a convenience store, a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer, and carted rims away from a tire store.

TV footage showed streams of people walking from a liquor store carrying bottles of alcohol, and in some cases protesters stood atop police cars or taunted officers who stood stoic, some carrying shields and batons. Video posted online by the St Louis Post-Dispatch showed a convenience store on fire.

Witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows. Television footage showed windows busted out of a TV station van.

Police were struggling to catch looters because crimes were happening at several locations in Ferguson and spilling into neighboring communities, Mayor James Knowles told KTVI-TV. It wasn’t immediately clear how many arrests were made. Authorities set up blockades to keep people from the most looted areas.

St Louis County executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries as of about 11pm But there were scattered reports of assaults into the early morning. Pat Washington, a spokeswoman for Dooley, said tear gas had been used. There were scattered media reports of gunfire but authorities did not immediately confirm any.

“The small group of people are creating a huge mess,” Knowles told KTVI-TV. “Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We’re only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors.”

Earlier Sunday, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson police headquarters. Some marched into an adjacent police building chanting “Don’t shoot me” while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn’t use force; the crowd eventually left.

County police chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after an officer encountered Brown and another man outside an apartment complex in Ferguson.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and a struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer’s gun inside the police car. Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn’t known and that all shell casings at the scene matched the officer’s gun. Police were investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.

Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged and it wasn’t clear if he was armed.

Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV there’s no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn’t yet put to use.

Jackson said blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer who shot him. Toxicology tests take weeks to complete.

Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she didn’t understand why police didn’t subdue her high school graduate son with a club or stun gun, and that the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

“I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,” she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

“We’re outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement,” said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.

St Louis County police department is in charge of the investigation, and Dooley said he will request an FBI investigation. The US Justice Department said attorney general Eric Holder instructed staff to monitor developments.

Jail records obtained by {local media outlets}<hyperlink=""http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/19/78-arrests-ferguson-overnight/14290361/""> revealed that 78 people were arrested in clashes with protesters overnight, despite a massive show of force by riot police and newly arrived national guard units. Officials had earlier put the number of people detained at 31.

But not long after the plea for calm, police in nearby St Louis said they had shot dead a man wielding a knife outside a convenience store.

Sam Dotson, the chief of the Metropolitan Police Department for the city of St Louis, said the man, who was 23 and black, was brandishing a knife at officers. He said the suspect was “acting erratically” and that people in the area contacted police. The victim had stolen two energy drinks from a convenience store, Dotson said.

Dotson said witnesses could hear the man saying “Shoot me now, kill me now,” and did not respond to requests to drop his weapon.

The incident threatened to inflame tensions further in the area, after another night of violence.

Overnight, {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> national guard troops entered a zone set aside for protests and police ordered the media to leave as officers in armoured vehicles fired teargas and stun grenades and engaged with agitators who fired gunshots and threw molotov cocktails.

The mayhem dashed hopes that the deployment of the national guard, and greater community efforts to control the small minority of violent protesters, would ease a crisis which flared after a local police officer shot Brown, 18, on 9 August.

Brown’s parents, {appearing on the Today show}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/michael-brown-parents-ferguson-justice-peace""> on NBC, said they believed the unrest would be alleviated if Darren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed their son was prosecuted.

“Justice will bring peace I believe,” Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s mother, told the Today show’s Matt Lauer. “Him being arrested, charges being filed and a prosecution. Him being held accountable for what he did.”

A grand jury will likely begin hearing evidence from witnesses to the shooting. A spokesman for the St Louis County prosecuting attorney, Bob McCulloch, who is overseeing the case, said his office would try to start presenting evidence on Wednesday during the regular once-a-week meeting date for the grand jury.

Residents in Ferguson cleaned up broken glass and other debris on Tuesday in what has become a ritual after the nightly clashes. With expectation of fresh unrest after sunset however there was little hope of any return to normality. The Ferguson-Florissant School District {said in a statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/no-school-in-ferguson-florissant-until-next-week-jennings-and/article_c2435462-d3e4-59f6-9edd-2ae6b5cfe438.html""> that schools would stay closed for the rest of the week to “allow needed time for peace and stability to be restored”.

The vast majority of people arrested on Monday night were from Missouri. All but three of the 78 were arrested for refusing to disperse, records show. Two people, both from the St Louis area, were arrested for unlawful use of a weapon, and a man from Illinois was arrested for interfering with an officer.

At a 2.20am press conference, Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri state highway patrol made an impassioned defence of the scale of the police response, which has come under sharp criticism. He said officers had acted with restraint against “criminal acts by a tiny minority of lawbreakers”.

Adding that police had at one point come under gunfire, and that several officers had been injured by rocks and bottles, Johnson urged peaceful protesters from now on to limit their demonstrations to daytime and not give cover to criminals at night.

“We’re going to make this neighbourhood whole, we’re going to make this community whole, and we’re going to do it together,” said Johnson, close to tears. “And I am not going to let criminals who come here from across the country or live in this community define this neighbourhood.”

On Tuesday the city of Ferguson issued a flyer saying: “It is our hope that as we continue to work for the wellbeing of Ferguson, residents will stay home at night, allow peace to settle in, and allow for the justice process to take its course. We owe it to our children to be able to return to school and work together peacefully for Ferguson’s future.”

Barack Obama has distanced himself from the decision to deploy the national guard. He has also {dispatched the attorney general,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/obama-attorney-general-eric-holder-ferguson""> Eric Holder, to monitor events and said he would be watching whether troops were “helping or hindering the situation”.

It is the {first time the national guard has been deployed}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/what-is-national-guard-ferguson-missouri""> to quell civil unrest in the United States since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.

Monday’s protest remained peaceful until about 10pm. More than a thousand people, including dozens of Pentecostal ministers, marched without incident under the gaze of police with helmets and shields.

When rowdy youths threw bottles of water at police, volunteers formed a line and herded them back. They begged the officers to not intervene: “Relax, we’ve got this, give us a chance.”

Initially police made limited interventions with snatch squads bolted forwards to grab and haul away certain individuals.

But more serious trouble flared at the site of a burned convenience store where dozens of youths, some with covered faces, ripped up street signs and taunted police. Unidentified gunmen opened fire, triggering volleys of police stun grenades and teargas.

Provocateurs had again {infiltrated a legitimate protest,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/ferguson-outsiders-protesters-riots-peaceful-unrest""> Ron Conway, a highway patrol captain who commands policing in Ferguson, told CNN. “That element that has been causing havoc got within the peaceful protest.” Two people were shot and were taken to hospital, he said.

The fiercest clashes took place near the site where Wilson shot Brown.

Police officials told local reporters that the man was shot in Ferguson by a St Louis County officer after pointing a handgun at him soon after 1am on Wednesday, following fresh demonstrations over the death on Saturday of Michael Brown.

The officer was responding to reports of shots being fired and men wearing ski masks carrying shotguns. The man was in critical condition in hospital, a police spokesman told the St Louis Post-Dispatch, Fox 2 and KMOV, and his gun was recovered at the scene.

A woman was separately being treated in hospital after being shot in the head during a drive-by shooting in the city. The incidents followed the peaceful end earlier to a tense standoff between protesters and police, prompting hopes of avoiding a third night of violence.

A raucous convoy of about 250 young demonstrators, marching along a main route into downtown Ferguson, was halted about 30 yards from a wall of police assembled at the entrance to the street where {Brown was killed by a still-unidentified officer on Saturday.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality"">

Officers in military-style uniforms, some carrying high-powered rifles and wearing balaclavas, formed a line at least two men deep and blocking the entire width of Florrisant Street, the main drag where angry protests over Brown's killing had flared for the previous two nights.

Pitched behind two large armoured trucks, they repeatedly warned the demonstrators through a Tannoy system to ""get out of the road or face arrest"" – the same warning delivered on Monday night before officers fired teargas, rubber bullets and wooden baton rounds into the crowds.

But for 40 minutes, the protesters defied the threat. Some hung out of car windows, while others raised their arms aloft and repeated what has become their defining slogan: ""Hands up, don't shoot."" A police helicopter swooped around the dark sky above, shining a bright spotlight on the faces of the almost entirely African American crowd.

""Heavenly father, help us as we continue on this journey of justice,"" Rasheen Aldridge, a 20-year-old self-appointed leader of the group, told them through a megaphone. ""The people behind us, they will do what they will do. Only you can judge us; only you can protect us.""

As the police declined to follow through with arrests, furious members of the crowd screamed obscenities at officers and urged them to ""shoot those rubber bullets"". But after 40 minutes in which it seemed that a repeat of Monday night's clashes would happen at any moment, the protesters abruptly melted away.

Patricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman for Ferguson, who was observing the standoff nervously, said she hoped its resolution signalled an end to the violent clashes. ""But there is definitely still an antagonism there,"" said Bynes.

In the early hours of Wednesday it was reported that a small skirmish had resulted in police again using teargas and a young woman being struck in the head with a projectile. Spookwrites, an Instagram user who had previously been covering the protests, {posted a photograph of herself}<hyperlink=""http://www.enjoygram.com/m/785907068722039283_23622385""> wearing a neck brace and showing cuts on her face.

""We have a right to assemble, a right to freedom,"" said Paul Muhammad. ""But here we are facing what looks like a military imposing martial law. It is not acceptable.""

The protesters had marched from a church more than a mile away, where earlier in the evening the Rev Al Sharpton, the veteran civil rights leader and TV host, appeared alongside Brown's parents to appeal for calm after two nights in which about 50 people were arrested.

Ferguson police refused on Tuesday to release the name of the officer who shot Brown in sharply disputed circumstances. While police say that Brown assaulted the officer during a struggle, witnesses said he was shot while trying to run away after being grabbed by the officer when he and a friend would not leave the road and walk on the pavement.

For the previous three hours, the officers held their line while being approached by several people who gestured at them or aired complaints. One man, who refused to stop walking, promptly found his chest emblazoned with the red dot of a laser sight from an officer's gun.

Lawanda Wallace, 40, got closer than anyone else to the stone-faced officers and accused them of racism. ""It's just the same as 40 years ago,"" said Wallace. ""When white people do it, it's an honest uprising; when black folks do it, it's rioting and looting.""

A series of cars, some of whose drivers seemed to be taunting the officers, also approached the police line. One man drove towards them at such speed, and stopped so short of hitting officers, that several people watching gasped and screamed in anticipation of a crash or a shooting to prevent one.

As the man turned his car around and drove away, he poked his head out of his driver-side window and smiled. ""I don't know what's up with them,"" he said of the police.

The Ferguson city police officer who shot Brown has not been named publicly, but has been placed on paid leave while the shooting is investigated by the separate St Louis county police department. The FBI is also looking into whether the incident caused civil rights violations.

In a statement on Tuesday, Barack Obama described Brown's death as ""heartbreaking"". Noting the FBI investigation, the president appealed for calm. ""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.""

The official response to Brown's death has been rejected as insultingly inadequate by many African American residents of Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 people where 67% of the population is black, yet 94% of the police force – and prominent figures in local government, such as the mayor – are white.",479,4307,"Man is said to be in critical condition in hospital after fresh demonstrations over police shooting of Michael Brown, 18",NA
Guardian,guard41,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/obama-ferguson-federal-intervention,Obama bucks past presidents' trends amid calls for martial law in Ferguson,Dan Roberts,08/14/14,04/11/16,"{Barack Obama}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama""> has instructed the Department of Justice to monitor the reaction of law enforcement authorities in Missouri in the aftermath of the shooting dead by police of an unarmed 18-year-old, but has so far stopped short of ordering a more dramatic federal intervention.

After four nights of violent disturbances in the city of {Ferguson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> the president on Thursday did not go as far as to condemn local police and appealed for calm from all sides, but urged the state governor, Jay Nixon, to ensure the official response was proportionate.

Obama said he had asked the attorney general, Eric Holder, to provide a report on the crisis, adding to an existing FBI investigation into possible civil rights violations during the death of Michael Brown last weekend.

“Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done, and I have asked that the attorney general and the US attorney on the scene to continue to work with local officials to move that process forward,” said Obama. “They will be reporting to me in the coming days about what’s being done to make sure that happens.”

The heavy-handed police response to protests in Ferguson prompted growing political anger in Washington on Thursday, including calls from the veteran civil rights activist and congressman John Lewis for the White House to send in national guard troops under federal control to take over local policing and ensure protesters were protected.

“This is not China or Russia or Syria,” said Lewis. “This is America, and in this country we have a right to protest in an orderly non-violent fashion.”

He compared the need for some “martial law” to restore trust in Ferguson to President Kennedy’s decision to send federal marshals to Montgomery, Alabama, during violent civil rights protests that Lewis took part in during 1961.

Similar moves were taken by President Johnson in 1965 when he sent the national guard into Selma, Alabama, under direct control from Washington to protect marchers from local police.

The last time the national guard was “federalised”, or put under the control of the president rather than state governors, was in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots that followed the beating of Rodney King by LA police officers.

In total, national guard troops have only been sent in to deal with domestic crises in this way on ten occasions since the second world war – mostly to help protect civil rights protesters in the 1950s and 1960s.

Such a move in this instance is likely to add to fears of an overly militarised response by police, however. Though the national guard has units of military police who are trained to deal with civil disturbances, 90% of its members are made up of part-time volunteers who would have to be called up and may rely on similar equipment to that currently used by Ferguson police.

Previous presidents have largely used executive orders to make deployments, something that Obama has currently shown no sign of wanting to do in this instance.

Instead, the White House seems to be relying on the civil rights division of the Department of Justice to oversee actions by state and county police in Ferguson as well as the local office of the Federal Bureau of Investigations.

The FBI confirmed it was already taking a lead role in investigating potential civil rights violations connected with the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson but was currently providing a support role for police in responding to the protests that followed.

“We are the lead investigative organisation for federal civil rights violations, which is why we opened a separate case,” Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI’s St Louis field office, told the Guardian.

“But there are a lot of overlapping [alleged] violations, so it depends on when the investigations are complete which prosecuting agency is going to have the evidence to support an actual charge.”

She declined to say how many federal officers were involved, citing safety concerns and threats against law enforcement, but revealed that FBI intelligence analysts were also assisting local and state police deal with public order problems.

“I wouldn’t say we have agents handling riot control, that not’s something we would do unless the scale of it continues to grow, but we do have agents providing support – on the investigative end of it and just looking at the intelligence, for example Anonymous claiming hack attacks against the police department,” added Mimura.

Civil rights activists said the crisis pointed to the need for greater national monitoring of racial discrimination by police.

“The tragic shooting of Michael Brown and the events in Ferguson underscore the gap between what our constitution requires and our society is currently confronting in terms of race discrimination,” said Chandra Bhatnagar, senior staff attorney at ACLU Human Rights Programme.

Ejim Dike, director of US Human Rights Network, added: “In addition to a legal response from the Department of Justice, there is a need for moral and political leadership from the executive branch, from Obama and Holder. We think the federal government should show moral leadership by making clear statements about what policing should look like.”

Other national politicians, including the Republican senator Rand Paul, criticised what they called an already overly militarised police response in Ferguson and linked it to government abuse of individual rights in wider cases.

“When you couple this militarisation of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury – national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture – we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands,” said Paul in an {opinion column for Time magazine.}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/"">",27,171,"President asked Eric Holder to provide a report on the crisis, as veteran civil rights activist John Lewis asked for martial law",NA

Studying did not come easily, but the 18-year-old worked hard at Normandy high school and graduated in May. Mike had been due to start classes at Vatterott College last Monday. He was excited to enter the world of business.

""This is a boy who did everything right,"" said Cornell Brooks, the president of the {National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,}<hyperlink=""http://www.naacp.org/?gclid=CMCevOrHjsACFcSWtAodW14Ayg""> ""who never got into a fight, who stayed in school.""

While some boys would get into edgy scrapes, Mike, a ""gentle giant"", wasn't interested, said Chris McMillan, a 20-year-old childhood friend who grew up playing PlayStation with Brown.

""He was a cool person,"" said McMillan. ""He was laidback and respectful. None of that nonsense. None of the crews and gangs. We'd just play games, chill, and ride around.""

On Saturday afternoon, {Brown was shot to death by a police officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/vigil-st-louis-teenager-killed-police--violence""> while apparently walking, unarmed, from a convenience store to his grandmother's apartment in Ferguson, a working-class suburb north of St Louis, the main hub of this midwestern state.

The lethal flash of violence has sparked a series of furious protests across the small city, and a fresh crisis over civil rights and police brutality in the US.

Acknowledging that Brown was shot ""more than just a couple of times"", police chiefs have said in a partial explanation that the shooting followed a struggle in the officer's patrol car over his gun, during which Brown ""physically assaulted"" him.

But this is dismissed by Dorian Johnson, a friend who said he was walking with Brown. Johnson told MSNBC that the officer ordered the pair, who were walking in the road, to ""get the fuck on to the sidewalk"".

They told him that they were almost at their destination, and continued.

The officer, according to Johnson's account, tried to open the door of his patrol car, but it struck Brown and bounced back. Johnson, 22, claimed that the officer then grabbed Brown by the neck and struggled with him, twice threatening: ""I'll shoot.""

""I seen the barrel of the gun pointed at my friend,"" Johnson said. ""I seen the fire come out of the barrel."" Johnson claimed that the pair ran, but the officer caught up with Brown and shot him several more times at close range. Johnson's lawyer said police had declined to speak to him.

The officer, a Ferguson city police officer who has not been named publicly, has been placed on paid leave while the shooting is investigated by the separate St Louis county police department. The FBI is also looking into whether the incident caused civil rights violations.

In a statement on Tuesday, Barack Obama described Brown's death as ""heartbreaking"". Noting the FBI investigation, the president appealed for calm.

We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.""

The official response to Brown's death has been rejected as insultingly inadequate by many African-American residents of Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 people where 67% of the population is black, yet 94% of the police force – and prominent figures in local government, such as the mayor – are white.

""I got seven brothers,"" said Brittany Troupe, 24, who said she worked at Home Depot and studied fine art in her spare time. ""Are they going to be killed by the men who are supposed to protect and serve them? It hurts my heart.""

""We want this man arrested, in jail, and charged for murder,"" the Rev James Stewart, pastor of the nearby Murchison Tabernacle church, said of the officer involved, to loud applause at a town hall meeting.

Brooks accused the police of a ""subculture"" of racism.

After a day of searing sunshine, seething young protesters took to the streets again on Monday night, 24 hours after a similar demonstration led to looting and the burning down of a petrol station. They scrawled slogans such as ""Avenge Mike Brown"" and ""Kill cops"" on mailboxes.

While some protesters threw bricks and stones at police, others walked with their arms aloft, saying: ""Hands up, don't shoot!"" Police in riot gear from several forces across the region used dogs, tear gas and rubber bullets to quell the protests.

Demonstrators were dispersed by being shot at with solid wooden baton rounds, a controversial ""less lethal"" crowd control weapon. Steve Walsh, 26, displayed a bloody wound to his neck, which he said was caused by one of the rounds.

Demonstrators loudly and repeatedly accused the city police of hating black people. Some compared Brown's killing to those of Eric Garner at the hands of police in New York earlier this month and the fatal shooting by a neighbourhood watch captain of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old, in Florida, in 2012.

""They killed another young black man in America,"" said Derek Chappel, 21, who said that he was shot in the abdomen and on one of his legs by some kind of non-lethal projectile. ""That was my friend they shot.""

Exasperated civil rights leaders pointed to the stability of Brown's family life as evidence against repeated claims that a lack of father figures, or broken homes, are to blame for violence blighting the lives of many African-American boys. Brown was close to both his father, Michael Brown senior, and his stepfather, Louis Head.

""Michael Brown as a young man came up in a community,"" said Brooks. ""He came up in a family, a mother who loved him, a father who loved him, a stepfather who loved him, friends who loved him, classmates who loved him.""

Brown's parents appeared on Tuesday alongside the Rev Al Sharpton, the prominent civil rights leader, who called for the federal government to take over the investigation into the shooting.

His distraught mother, Lesley McSpadden, has lamented that all Mike's efforts were for nothing.

""Do you know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school and graduate?"" McSpadden asked earlier on KMOV, a local TV station. ""You know how many black men graduate?

""Not many. Because you bring them down to this type of level, where they feel like they don't got nothing to live for anyway.""",4,2747,African American teenager's killing by police puts Missouri city on edge after another night of protests,NA

But unforeseen as it must have been, the opportunity to deal with the crisis from the White House rather than the backdrop of golf courses and beaches presents a chance for the president to inject greater urgency into the administration’s response.

For despite protestations to the contrary from his advisers, the president has at times appeared far removed from events unfolding on the streets of Ferguson.

Unconfirmed reports on Monday that the White House was not even warned of a decision by Missouri governor Jay Nixon {to deploy national guard troops}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-national-guard-protests-updates#block-53f22840e4b0f23fdd935186""> only served to compound fears that the aggressive local response to demonstrators in Ferguson was unchecked by federal authorities.

Obama’s initial condolences to the family of Michael Brown contrasted with his much angrier response to the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 – a killing that famously prompted the president {to observe}<hyperlink=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-if-i-had-a-son-hed-look-like-trayvon/2012/03/23/gIQApKPpVS_story.html"">: “if I had a son, he would look like Trayvon.”

White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, who along with Obama and attorney general {Eric Holder}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-holder""> is one of three powerful African Americans at the heart of the administration’s response to Brown’s shooting, insists the president sympathises but that he is focused on community safety rather than the specifics of the case.

“Our immediate goal is to make sure the residents of Ferguson are safe; that the looting stops, the vandalism stops, that the people who live in the community have confidence that justice will be done,” said Jarrett {in an interview with American Urban Radio Networks.}<hyperlink=""http://www.aurn.com/webex.php?itemID=5941&categoryID=1"">

“He looks at this – I spoke with him this morning – his concern was clearly thinking about it as a perspective of a parent, and you want to know when you send your kids to school, when you leave your home they’re going to be safe.”

In Obama’s only public address on the subject – at an impromptu press briefing last Wednesday – the president was also careful not to take sides.

“There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,” he said. “There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their first amendment rights.”

There is no doubt the administration is angry at what many in Washington perceive to be an inflammatory and overly aggressive police response. Holder was reported by the Wall Street Journal on Monday to have told his staff: “Tell them to remove the damn tanks.”

Holder was also quick to announce a separate FBI investigation into the circumstances of Brown’s death, including an independent autopsy to assess whether there were civil rights violations.

But both Obama and Holder have been careful to describe the federal response to the policing of the protests as one of working alongside local authorities rather than taking more radical steps such as putting the national guard under federal control, something that was done by president George HW Bush after the LA riots in 1992.

Perhaps anxious not to prejudge the FBI inquiry, or just made nervous by the drip of negative official reports about Brown, such as CCTV footage of an alleged robbery, the administration has been unwilling to distance itself from the actions of Democratic governor Nixon.

Obama did however instruct Holder to review the actions of state and local authorities last week and their discussions at the White House on Monday may now force the president to decide whether to take {a more hands-on federal response.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/obama-ferguson-federal-intervention"">

Asked whether the White House needed to do more about the ongoing crisis, Jarrett said Holder and Obama would be evaluating next steps, including whether there were “any further actions that the federal government could play to help reduce the violence down to zero” but also urged patience.

“Let’s get through the next few days and make sure that happens in a responsible way, and then the days and weeks ahead will determine the next steps,” said Jarrett.",NA,43,President returns from vacation on Martha’s Vineyard for discussions with attorney general and top advisers,NA

The ruins of a QuikTrip store, a focus for protests and now a charred, gutted carcass, blazed in the flashes then lapsed back into blackness.

Hundreds milled on Florissant Avenue, impervious to the pelting rain, and debated whether to leave, as some urged, or stay and defy the curfew. Police in riot gear observed from each end of the street, blue lights rotating on their trucks, silent.

This was {Saturday,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/17/ferguson-protesters-curfew-riot-police""> the seventh consecutive night of protests after a police officer {shot dead Michael Brown,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/michael-brown-ferguson-murder-race-relations-white-police""> an unarmed teenager, and the St Louis suburb pulsed with a conviction that it was at the heart of something momentous.

“Right here, right now!” shouted a young, bare-chested man, running from group to group. “Right here, right now!”

For everyone here, the immediate choice was whether to scoot indoors or stay put and violate the curfew, part of a state of emergency that Missouri governor Jay Nixon, exasperated with the continuing protests and struggling to find an effective response, {had declared hours earlier.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/missouri-governor-curfew-state-of-emergency-ferguson"">

The greater dilemma, one faced by the African American community at large as well as authorities and policymakers, was how to respond to a crisis which roared out from the slumber of a {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> summer, hurling questions about police violence, racial inequality and marginalisation.

The weather had Shakespearean timing but this was a tempest not just for the police, whose {militarised response}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-military-restraints-violence-weaponry-missouri""> affronted worldwide opinion, or their political masters, but for local and national black leaders. All this energy: how to use it? “They left hours ago,” said Timothy Gist, 24, who studies criminology and sociology at the University of Missouri, rain dripping from his beard. “Look around, it’s a different crowd now.”

He was right. When a hot sun beat down earlier, activists and leaders from the New Black Panthers, the Nation of Islam and Christian groups such as Disciples of Justice had been out briefing crowds, directing traffic, distributing water and liaising with police. As curfew approached they urged people to leave, then left themselves. It was responsible advice and action, given the nightly disturbances and the prospect of arrest, but it left the field to local youths and outsiders, white and black, some of them spoiling for a fight.

There was one exception: {Antonio French,}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/AntonioFrench""> an alderman of the 21st ward who has been out with protestors night after night, earning a brief stint in jail. But he has no organisational heft to shape events.

Gist, softly spoken with a wrestler’s build, said community leaders wanted to show discipline and lawfulness by respecting the curfew but many local youths had another priority. “It’s about pride. They don’t want to be punked out of their own neighbourhood.”

Earlier that day the civil rights campaigner Jesse Jackson fell foul of the generational gulf when he asked a Ferguson audience to donate generously to a church, prompting scorn. “We were, ‘What? People here are poor. And angry.’ It was the wrong way to do it,” said Jonathan Butler, 24, who is studying for a master’s in higher education.

{Al Sharpton,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/sharpton-ferguson-protesters-smear-campaign-rioting""> another civil rights veteran, met a respectful but subdued response during his visits. “Young people know him but” – Butler sought a diplomatic expression – “it seems he may be doing it for camera time.”

Confusion over Brown’s funeral – multiple groups claim to be funding it – has further dented credibility. The highly unusual decision by the Department of Justice to hold an additional autopsy, announced on Sunday and to be performed by federal medical examiners, may further delay Brown’s burial.

In the absence of an obvious Prospero, many young protestors seem to think they are on their own, that they are the ones routinely harassed by police and that it is their prerogative to unleash a storm.

The looters who smashed windows and pillaged stores are a tiny minority, and many volunteers have tried to repair the damage and protect businesses, but there is tacit acknowledgment that the mayhem has unfurled longstanding grievances.

Gist pointed at the conflict’s landmark. “Was burning the QuikTrip necessary? No. But it got attention.” On cue, a bolt of lightning illuminated wreckage which has been beamed around the world.

Butler, a fraternity buddy, drew a parallel with the 1960s: Martin Luther King’s righteousness combined with Black Panther edge. “You need both.” No one planned it, he said, but on a smaller scale Ferguson had replicated that mix of moral force and menace.

Should authorities decide not to charge Darren Wilson, {the police officer who shot Brown,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/ferguson-police-darren-wilson-michael-brown-shooting""> there will be an explosion, Gist predicted. “People are already planning attacks. First the fire stations, to cut the lines, then the police stations.” He shrugged. Drastic times, drastic measures.

Such talk baffles many white people, even Ron Goff, 65, a retired mailman who lives just five minutes away amid black neighbours he considers friends. “The protests are overdone,” he said. Black motorists should not cry racism if they are fined for lacking insurance or broken tail lights, he said. The problem was poverty, not race. “Low income, high crime, that’s just the way it is.”

Protestors, young and old, peaceful and rowdy, disagreed. The African American experience began in chains; centuries later inequality endures in jobs, housing, income and power. What good is a black man in the White House when in Ferguson, {which is two-thirds black,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/ferguson-michael-brown-unrest-reality-segregated-society""> five of six city councillors are white and 50 of 53 police officers are white? Median income in northern St Louis, almost entirely black, is $18,000. In the mostly white south, it’s $50,000.

Almost every protestor interviewed by the Guardian this weekend offered personal anecdotes about police harassment and “disrespect”. Grievances expanded to include the recent police shooting of a mentally ill black man in Los Angeles, and the humiliation of a Brooklyn grandmother {dragged nearly naked from her apartment,}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/nypd-officers-drag-naked-brooklyn-woman-apartment-video-article-1.1889292""> to the historical sins of lynching, segregation and Jim Crow.

The 9 August shooting of Michael Brown was the last straw. It was not just his death: his body was left under a baking sun, uncovered, for hours and for everyone to see. Police responded to protestors as if hunting a wartime enemy: khaki uniforms, armoured vehicles, sniper nests.

Stung by the outcry, Governor Nixon appointed {Ron Johnson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/17/ron-johnson-ferguson-cop-middle-road-critics""> a black highway patrol captain, to take command. His softer approach briefly calmed the situation.

The curfew was the governor’s attempt to curb that renewed violence. Some residents welcomed it. To the crowd still milling on Florissant Avenue at the stroke of midnight it was a provocation. “Come get me!” yelled the bare-chested man to the police lines.

They didn’t, not at first. Instead, as the rain hardened the crowd edged towards its adversary, chanting “Hands up, don’t shoot!” and “Fuck the police!”

Butler and Gist, the university students, had fantasised about stewards linking arms and shouting instructions, about tactics and coherence amid the law-breaking defiance. But there was no visible organisation or direction, just raw energy.

Aaron, a 28-year-old nurse with a degree in black history and a young child at home, watched approvingly from the sidelines. “This has been a couple of hundred years in the making, man,” he said. When the oppressed rose up, some chaos was OK. “Right now everyone is a leader for themselves.”

Minutes later, police fired teargas and everyone started running, coughing, retching. Someone fired shots at a police car. Others broke slabs of sidewalk to hurl. Police trucks advanced, followed by uniformed phalanxes with riot shields and helmets. Resistance swiftly folded. The tally: one serious gunshot injury, seven arrests.

Al Sharpton was back in Ferguson on Sunday afternoon, for another rally. “They’re not going to cry alone,” he said, embracing Brown’s parents. “We have had enough.” Their son’s death would be a “defining moment” for US policing, he predicted.

“Justice will bring peace I believe,” Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s mother, told the Today show’s Matt Lauer. “Him being arrested, charges being filed and a prosecution. Him being held accountable for what he did.”

Referring to an independent {autopsy conducted by Dr Michael Baden}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/michael-brown-autopsy-teenager-surrendering-ferguson""> at their request, Lauer asked McSpadden and Brown’s father, Michael Brown Sr: “Did you learn what you think you needed to know from that autopsy that gives you a clearer picture of what happened to your son that night?”

“No,” Brown said.

“What more do you need to know?” Lauer asked.

“Why?” McSpadden asked, followed by Brown, who agreed, “Why? What was the cause for that excessive force? Nobody deserves that.”

Brown’s parents appeared to have slightly differing views on the impact the protests are having on their search for justice. Asked by Lauer, “Do you think this continuing violence in the streets of Ferguson night after night runs the risk of overshadowing that search for justice?” Brown responded “No,” but McSpadden said, “I think that it does somewhat, because it is a distraction, but we won’t let it distract us to the point that we lose focus. We have to remain focused and we have to remain strong and the violence needs to stop. When justice is prevailed then maybe they’ll regain their trust in the locals but right now it’s really out of control.”

Guardian,guard46,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/19/ice-bucket-challenge-ferguson-social-media,It's OK to read this story about the ice bucket challenge before Ferguson. Trust me: you can read about that next,Jess Zimmerman,08/19/14,04/11/16,"I became aware of the ice bucket challenge, as I become aware of so many things, through snarky tweets. Over the last week, my Twitter feed has been consumed by the latest social media-dominating entry in a summer full of tragedies: the events in Ferguson, Missouri. But occasionally a fed-up post will surface: “Why is my Facebook feed full of ice bucket challenge videos?” “STOP TALKING ABOUT THE ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE.” “What the hell is an ice bucket challenge, anyway?”

An ice bucket challenge, my fellow news junkie who has carefully unhooked your social media feeds from celebrity shenanigans, is a fundraising concept created by the {ALS Association}<hyperlink=""http://www.alsa.org/?referrer=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/19/ice-bucket-challenge-ferguson-social-media""> of America, which raises money and awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease). The challenge asks participants – mostly celebs – to do one of two things: donate money to ALS research, or pour a bucket of ice water over their heads. You can, in other words, choose to help or choose to suffer for not helping. As Valleywag {sneered}<hyperlink=""http://valleywag.gawker.com/mark-zuckerberg-would-rather-drench-himself-than-give-1621590069""> when the Facebook founder took Door No2, “Mark Zuckerberg would rather drench himself than give $100 to charity.”

Like many people who use social media as a replacement for 24-hour news channels, I haven’t been willing to look away from Ferguson for going on 10 days now. But even more than that, I haven’t been willing to be seen looking away. Every time I make a frivolous social media post about books or dogs or dick jokes, I feel a twinge: is it OK yet to care about something else, too? I feel like I should say sorry when I look elsewhere. I’ve seen people say it, or insinuate that their followers or friends – or, more likely, their social media enemies – should feel guilty for turning their heads.

Especially if they’re turning it to look at {Mark Zuckerberg}<hyperlink=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg""> (or Weird Al, or Taylor Swift, or whomever). Newshounds on Twitter have been using the ice bucket challenge as a shorthand for “thing people are paying attention to that isn’t the current crisis” – and therefore casting it as frivolous, a celebrity stunt, something to be shouted down. This is the unspoken expectation when something big happens: either you’re talking about it, preferably talking about what you’re doing about it, or you’re inwardly or outwardly apologizing – or, worse, chastising others – for talking about something else. To do otherwise is to invite accusations, from yourself or others, that your empathy and priorities have gone to hell.

But policing reactions this way means we’re doing a version of the ice bucket challenge ourselves: Donate the whole of your focus now, or absolve yourself through an act of performative self-flagellation.

That’s nonsense. Paying attention sporadically – or even not at all – is still more useful than chiding ourselves or others for looking away. We all look away all the time. When we fixate on Ferguson, we relegate Iraq and Gaza and Syria and Ukraine to our peripheral vision – or if, instead, we stay focused on those, or on an Ebola outbreak or whatever emergency may come next, we may not have the bandwidth left for police atrocities in middle America. News of Robin Williams’s death surfaced as the Ferguson story was unfolding, and many of us looked away from police thuggery momentarily to talk about depression and self-harm. When we scoff at the ice bucket challenge because we’re busy with Ferguson, we look away from ALS and the havoc it wreaks on sufferers and their families. These are choices we get to make – maybe choices we must make, since it’s psychologically difficult enough to steep yourself in one tragedy, and trying to focus on all of them simultaneously is a recipe for a fevered brain that no amount of ice will fix.

There are big things to worry about this week, but that’s not why the ice bucket challenge is ridiculous. The way it’s playing out, it’s not even that ridiculous at all – most participants who go for the ice bucket are choosing to donate, too, and it’s been a {successful fundraising campaign}<hyperlink=""http://www.alsa.org/news/media/press-releases/ice-bucket-challenge-0818.html""> as well as a consciousness-raising one. But in its original construction, the challenge offers two choices: do something, or go soak your head. This dichotomy between action and guilt is false. It’s false when it comes to donating money to an ALS cure, and it’s false when it comes to donating effort and attention to violations of human rights. The amount you contribute, however small, will inch your cause closer to its goal, but your tiny penance is worthless. If you assuage your guilt by performing self-recrimination for an audience, you might as well be Mark Zuckerberg freezing his skull off to save a hundred bucks. The Ferguson protesters do not have time to stand still and watch you douse yourself with ice in a bid for absolution.

Nor is anyone served when people “contribute” by scolding others for losing focus – with one potential exception. It appears a whole crop of celebrities are willing to be briefly cold and wet in penance for not funding ALS research. We have a chance to put the 30 seconds of discomfort they’re willing to endure to good use. Who wouldn’t pay to dump ice water on Mark Zuckerberg?

Brown was shot “at least” six times by officer Darren Wilson and was ultimately killed by a bullet that entered the top of his head and travelled “back to front”, attorney Daryl Parks said the autopsy had found, arguing this showed Brown was fatally shot when his head was well bowed.

Dr Michael Baden, who carried out the autopsy, said that “there weren’t signs of a struggle” on Brown’s body. Police have said that Brown assaulted Wilson after the officer stopped him and a friend and told them to walk on the sidewalk rather than in the road on 9 August.

However Baden, the former chief medical examiner for New York City, was more cautious than the lawyers, stating that the findings in his preliminary report “could be consistent” with suggestions that Brown had been shot while charging at Wilson. “It’s possible,” he said.

“There are many different witness testimonies,” said Baden. “Many seem to line up in one direction, some in another direction. Right now until we get more information we can’t, from a forensic science point of view, can’t distinguish and can’t make an absolute judgment.”

The autopsy findings were released officially shortly before troops from the national guard began arriving in Ferguson, where more than a week of unrest prompted governor Jay Nixon {to sign an executive order for their deployment}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-michael-brown-national-guard-deployed""> in the early hours of Monday morning, following the most intense clashes so far. Publishing the order that put the troops on the streets, Nixon also announced the {abandonment of a curfew,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-national-guard-protests-updates""> in place for the previous two nights, which had failed to stop people congregating in the streets.

Nixon stressed that the guard had “limited responsibilities”.

He said they would primarily “provide protection, and ensure the safety of our unified command centre, which was the target last night of a coordinated attack”. Nixon said there would be no five-hour curfew from midnight as had been implemented the last two nights.

Professor Shawn Parcells, a pathologist who worked on the autopsy with Baden, said that one shot, to the middle of Brown’s right arm, “could have occurred when he was putting his hands up”. Witnesses have said that at one point the 18-year-old threw his arms in the air in surrender. Parcells said two of the shots passed through and re-entered different parts of Brown’s body.

Benjamin Crump, the lead attorney for the Brown family, said the findings indicated that Brown “did not suffer”. He said Brown’s parents had insisted on a independent post-mortem. “They did not want to be left having to rely on the autopsy done by the St Louis law enforcement agencies, the same individuals they feel are responsible for executing their son in broad daylight,” he said.

The medical examiner for St Louis County, where authorities are investigating the shooting for potential criminal charges, has carried out a separate autopsy including a toxicology report. Its findings have not been published. {The Obama administration has ordered a third autopsy}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/obama-briefed-ferguson-pressure-federal-response""> to be carried out in order to assist a federal inquiry into whether civil rights were violated by the killing.

The pathologists said that they did not know the order in which the shots were fired, but that the two shots to the head were likely to have been the last. “All of these gunshot wounds were survivable except the one to the top of the head,” said Baden.

Baden also said Brown’s body showed “no gunshot residues on the skin surface, so the muzzle of the gun was at least one or two feet away. It could have been 30 feet away.” But he said to confirm this he would need to search Brown’s clothing for gunshot residue and had not yet had access to it. He said Brown suffered abrasions to his face when he fell to the ground.

Wilson, the officer who killed Brown, has not spoken publicly but a friend of the family, who declined to be named, told the Guardian that the officer admits he shot the teenager in the head. However, his version of events contradicts aspects of the accounts given by some other eyewitnesses, including Dorian Johnson.

There appears to be little dispute that an altercation took place when Wilson encountered Brown and Johnson, shortly after a robbery at a convenience store. Brown then made off, but quickly turned back.

In Wilson’s version, Brown was moving towards the officer in a threatening manner when he was shot. The autopsy concludes that all the shots were fired from the front.

Wilson’s account is that Brown continued to move towards him even after the first shots were fired, and did not stop until suffering a mortal wound to the head. “He just kept coming,” the friend said, characterising Wilson’s account.

The Department of Justice, which is leading a civil-rights investigation into the killing, on Sunday took {the unusual step}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/obama-briefed-ferguson-pressure-federal-response""> of ordering a federal medical examiner to conduct a third autopsy on Brown’s body. A spokesman for Eric Holder, the attorney general, cited the “extraordinary circumstances” of the case for the decision.

Both sides in what is becoming an increasingly incendiary and politicised story are likely to offer different interpretations: that Wilson fired in self-defence; or that six bullets showed excessive force.
Friends of Wilson and his girlfriend, Barbara Spradling, also a Ferguson police officer, have expressed concern about the racial and institutional politics involved, worrying that the charged environment may unduly influence the case.
In addition to concerns for their safety, friends of Spradling and Wilson believe his reputation has been unfairly tarnished by a rush to judgment from the media and some members of the public.
One friend of Spradling believes the legitimacy of any evidence supporting Wilson’s version of events will be questioned by protesters.",NA,992,"• Doctor says no signs of a struggle on Brown’s body

Jackson said people threw rocks at police and gunfire came from the crowd. He says officers used teargas and shot “beanbag rounds” meant to stun them.

An Associated Press photographer said police were telling people to go home but authorities had blocked exit streets off. Jackson said police blocked off the area where most of the looting and vandalism occurred the previous night out of concern that cars passing by might hit demonstrators in the street.

Jackson said officers were focused on dispersing the crowd, which was smaller than the night before, but were making arrests and reported being fired on at some locations. “They are shooting at us now,” Jackson said, adding that officers from 10 to 15 jurisdictions were assisting Ferguson.

St Louis county police spokesman Brian Schellman later said there were at least five arrests and no reports of looting. He said police using loudspeakers were urging people to go home.

Looting and unrest initially broke out on Sunday following a vigil for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was {shot multiple times on Saturday after being confronted by an officer.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/st-louis-protesters-officer-teenager"">

The FBI opened an investigation on Monday into the death. Police have said Brown was shot multiple times on Saturday after being confronted by an officer in Ferguson, where nearly 70% of the 21,000 residents are black.

Authorities were vague about exactly what led the officer to open fire on Brown, except to say that the shooting was preceded by a scuffle with a man. It was unclear whether Brown or a man with him was involved in the altercation. Some witnesses have denied there was any scuffle under way involving Brown when he was shot.

The FBI was looking into possible civil rights violations, said Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the agency’s St Louis field office. The US attorney general, Eric Holder, said the case deserved a full review.

Following a candlelight vigil on Sunday night, crowds looted and burned stores, vandalised vehicles, assaulted and threatened reporters and taunted officers.

The facts of the Brown case are still unknown – and hotly debated. Police say the officer who shot Brown suffered a blow to the face during an altercation in which the teen tried to take the officer’s weapon. One of Brown’s friends, a witness to the shooting, disputed this account, and said his friend was shot multiple times as he began to flee, hands raised in a gesture of submission.

Among their demands, protesters have called for the officer who killed Michael Brown, 18, to be charged with murder. But experts say if history is any guide, it’s far from certain criminal charges will be brought against the officer. Here’s why:

When can an officer shoot?
While there is no national statute outlining police use of deadly force, there are national standards, established by a pair of 1980s US supreme court decisions.

David Klinger, an associate professor in the department of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri–St Louis and a former officer with the Los Angeles police department, said there are two permissible circumstances in which an officer can use lethal force.

1 Constitutionally, a police officer can shoot a suspect who is threatening the life of the officer, a fellow officer or a member of the public, said Klinger, a use-of-force expert. This is known as the “defence of life” standard.

2 An officer can also shoot a fleeing suspect if the officer believes the suspect has committed a violent felony and his or her escape would pose a significant and serious threat, he said.

The US constitution does not allow a police officer to shoot an unarmed, non-violent suspect in flight who does not pose a serious risk to public safety.

This was determined in a 1985 supreme court case, Garner v Tennessee. The justices ruled that deadly force “may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has {probable cause}<hyperlink=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause""> to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others”.

The decision limited the long-standing “fleeing felon” rule that permitted officers to use deadly force against a suspect who was trying to escape, even if the person in flight was not a threat to the public.

‘It’s not the Wild West’: state laws and departments’ protocol
The constitution establishes a clear framework within which states and police departments can further regulate deadly force, said Candace McCoy, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York.

“It’s not the Wild West out there,” she said.

McCoy said states, guided by the constitution, have adopted their own laws governing officers’ use of lethal force on suspects. The state laws can only be more restrictive of police action than the standards set by the supreme court, although McCoy said, it would be “hard to restrict that further, unless you say that police shouldn’t be carrying guns at all”.

Individual police departments also implement their own standards and protocol that outline the situations in which use of deadly force is appropriate. For example, Klinger said, some departments have imposed blanket bans on shooting a suspect in flight.

How the rules apply to the Brown case
A 1989 supreme court case, Graham v Connor, established an “objectively reasonable” standard, which applies in cases where a law enforcement officer stands accused of using excessive force. Klinger said “reasonableness” is based on how a “reasonable” officer at the scene would have responded and that the “use of force must be proportional to the threat”.

The standard is not based on the threat that existed, but the threat the officer believed existed.

Because the decisions are often made in split seconds and under extreme pressure, there can be a disparity between the threat a suspect actually posed at the time and what the officer perceived. For example, Klinger said, giving a somewhat improbable scenario as an example, that an officer could under that standard be found to have been justified in shooting a man wielding a hatchet against a young boy, even if it is later discovered that the hatchet was fake and the man was just role-playing with his son.

So, a key question for investigators to consider: Was shooting an unarmed teenager the objectively reasonable response given the specific set of circumstances the officer was dealing with at that time? In other words, did the officer “have reason to believe” Brown posed a threat – with or without a gun? This of course cannot be determined without the results from ongoing investigations into the shooting.

Holding officers accountable
A criminal investigation is standard protocol following an officer-involved shooting, whether the incident results in injury or death, Klinger said. Often the investigations are conducted by the department for which the officer works, which may cause the public to doubt their comprehensiveness and transparency, sometimes with good reason.

In Missouri, the St Louis County police department, not the Ferguson police, is conducting the criminal investigation into Brown’s death. The FBI is conducting a concurrent investigation that will evaluate whether the shooting violated Brown’s civil rights.

In 2012, Klinger published a study on shootings by the St Louis Metropolitan police department in which he recommended the department make public the findings from all investigations into officer involved shootings. Klinger said part of the process should include disclosing the names of the officers involved, although in this case, he said, he understands why officials in Ferguson withheld the name of the officer who shot Brown until Friday.

After an investigation is complete, the findings are delivered to a prosecutor who will decide if the officer acted within the confines of state law, Klinger said. If not, the prosecutor will then have to determine which crime to charge the officer with, and if there’s enough evidence to bring a criminal charge.

Despite protesters’ demands that the office be criminally charged, indictments of police officers are rare, and convictions even rarer, McCoy noted.

She said it’s notoriously difficult to convince a jury that an officer knew lethal force wasn’t an appropriate response in a given situation and took a shot anyway. Also, juries have a tendency to favour police officers because they typically make good witnesses and speak well, McCoy said.

In the case of Brown, McCoy said it’s hard to say anything definitively about what will happen without knowing the facts.

“It will be extremely difficult to prove this and a conviction is very unlikely,” she said. “The burden of proof is high.”",76,652,"In the Ferguson case, experts say it’s far from certain criminal charges will be brought against the officer who shot Brown",NA

The curfew was due to run from midnight to 5am.

Turning to a curfew as a means of controlling civil unrest is not new. In fact, its history is rooted in the American civil rights movement.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, African Americans filled the streets of Birmingham, Detroit, Philadelphia and Newark to demand equal rights, and cities increasingly responded with curfews, aggressively enforced by police. Prior to this, curfews were mostly a wartime phenomenon.

But civil liberties groups and many citizens fear curfews stifle free speech and the right of protestors to assembly.

“We criticize dictators for quelling dissent and silencing protesters with tactics like curfews; we’ll certainly speak out when it’s happening in our own backyard,” Steven Hawkins, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, said of the Ferguson curfew in a statement.

Although the citywide curfew has been used more often recently in response to natural disasters, it is still used on occasion as a way of controlling protests and civil unrests.

Los Angeles during the Rodney King riots
A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed in the city and county of Los Angeles during the 1992 riots that left more than 50 people dead and nearly 2,000 people injured. The riots erupted when four white officers with the LAPD were acquitted of severely beating a black man named Rodney King. The curfew lasted from 30 April to 4 May.

Cincinnati in 2001
Riots erupted in Cincinnati, Ohio, after a 19-year-old African American man was fatally shot by a city police officer in 2001. The streets raged for four days, with rioters vandalising buildings and looting local businesses. On the third day the mayor issued a citywide {curfew}<hyperlink=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-04-03-cincinnati-riots-anniversary_N.htm""> that ran from 8pm to 6am. The curfew is largely credited with quelling the riots.

Occupy Protests in 2011
During the Occupy protests, some cities issued curfews on parks or specific areas where protestors camped, or beefed up enforcement of curfews already in place. State police {arrested}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nyregion/occupy-albany-protesters-stand-up-to-curfew.html?_r=1""> protestors in Albany for violating the 11pm curfew imposed shortly before their demonstration by New York governor Andrew Cuomo.

New Orleans during hurricane Katrina
New Orleans imposed a mandatory curfew after hurricane Katrina struck Louisiana. Law enforcement used the curfew as a way of regaining control of the battered city amid widespread looting and disorder. New Orleans also imposed dusk-to-dawn curfews after hurricane Gustav in 2008 and hurricane Isaac in 2012.

For two hours, officers from several forces clashed with a crowd that had gathered steadily through Monday near the scene of the killing of Michael Brown. While some protesters threw bricks at police, others walked with their arms aloft, saying: “Hands up, don’t shoot.”

“We were just sitting on the ground in the street, singing We Shall Not Be Moved,” Chris McMillan, a 20-year-old childhood friend of Brown’s, told the Guardian, after emerging from a fog of teargas. “They told us, ‘Get off the street’, and then they started shooting gas canisters at us.

“It felt like torture. They shot them at me twice. It was all in my face, my eyes, my chest. It was in my mouth, and I couldn’t even breathe. I didn’t move until I had to run off, because my face was burning. They kept shooting.”

As police rapidly shut down access to the city from all sides, other officers – some wearing riot gear, including gas masks – steadily forced demonstrators down West Florissant Avenue, the main drag to the east of the suburb of about 21,000 people outside St Louis, Missouri.

Sergeant Colby Dolly, a spokesman for St Louis county police, said at a makeshift command centre early on Tuesday morning that some 150 officers had been involved in the operation and had made about 10 arrests.

Dolly said two protesters had suffered injuries serious enough that they were taken to hospital: one who said he suffered a seizure, and another with an apparently dislocated shoulder.

But others displayed the effects of tough police tactics and said they were in pain. Amid reports of gunfire around Ferguson, one police officer wearing full riot gear described the city as “a war zone” as he ordered reporters away from a row of stores.

Steve Walsh, 26, said he was struck in the neck by a wooden pellet after becoming caught up in clashes while walking to the home of his two-month-old son, Saveon, and the child’s mother. Disoriented and drenched in sweat, Walsh had a bloody, coin-sized wound behind his left ear. “I almost fainted,” said Walsh. “Blood just started coming out. I was just walking through.”

“It felt like my eyes were about to melt out of my head. My lips are still burning,” said Jaysha Ross, 20, who said that she, too, had suffered after inhaling teargas. “They hit an old lady, and I ran back to help her. Then they threw another one.”

Dolly confirmed the tactics were used to disperse people and said that protesters had effectively fired the first shot by throwing bricks. He told the Guardian: “They were given plenty of warnings, of well over a minute, from a loudspeaker, before projectiles or munitions were used. If you really didn’t want to be exposed to that, you did have time to move away.”

Two demonstrators said that they saw people struck with cylinder-shaped pellets of about two inches in length, made of what appeared to be compacted woodchip. “I saw a man get hit on the side of his face,” said Damon Bevly, 19, who works for a recycling company. “He had a fat bruise.”

Dolly said he did not recognise the description of pellets. Chief Thomas Jackson of the Ferguson city police told reporters on Monday night that officers had been using “beanbag rounds”.

Derek Chappel, 21, offered a view of two small lumps – one on the lower right-hand side of his abdomen, the other on his right thigh – as proof that he had been shot with some kind of non-lethal projectile.

“It stung for a minute, but they ain’t stopping us,” said Chappel. “It’s real messed up, man. We [are] just trying to have a protest. They killed another young black man in America. That was my friend they shot.”

Brown, a high school graduate who had been due to begin classes at Vatterott College on Monday, was shot multiple times by a police officer near an apartment block on Saturday. His parents have said that he was walking from a convenience store.

Police chiefs say the shooting followed a struggle in the officer’s patrol car over his gun, when Brown “physically assaulted” him. Yet this was dismissed by Dorian Johnson, a friend who was walking with Brown, and Piaget Crenshaw, a witness who claims to have seen the shooting.

They say that it followed a mere exchange of words, after the young men were told to walk on the pavement rather than in the road. Friends say Brown was fleeing with his hands in the air and accuse the police of a racist attack.

The shooting is being investigated by the St Louis county police department. The FBI is also looking into whether there are potential civil rights violations arising from it, according to a spokeswoman for the bureau’s St Louis field office.

Gunshots rang out again earlier on Monday on the street where Brown was shot, which baked in hot, bright sunshine throughout the afternoon. A young man was seen by the Guardian firing a pistol just yards away from a makeshift memorial to the 18-year-old at about 3.30pm.

The man walked out from the parking lot of an apartment block, stood beside a dumpster and shot several times at someone across the road who could not be seen, before heading east and out of sight. At least one shot appeared to be returned.

Some mourners who were gathered at the memorial hurried to their cars and drove away. A sign propped up between soft toys and candles and declared: “We demand answers / doesn’t make us a mob / it’s democracy.”

Despite officers being stationed at nearby shops and businesses, there was no police presence near the memorial and no officers arrived following the shooting. About 40 minutes later, a yellow school bus stopped at the spot where the man had fired and let off one young schoolboy, who smiled as he walked down the sidewalk wearing a backpack on both shoulders.

Brown’s father spoke publicly about the shooting for the first time on Monday. “We need justice for our son,” Michael Brown Sr repeated at a press conference. “We want justice for our son.” Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said: “No violence, no violence.”

The couple was supported by their attorney, Benjamin Crump, who previously represented the parents of {Trayvon Martin,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin""> the 17-year-old unarmed boy who was shot dead by a neighbourhood watch captain in 2012. “I don’t want to sugarcoat it – their baby was executed in broad daylight,” Crump said of Brown’s parents.

Earlier, at a town hall meeting convened at a Christian Methodist Episcopal church by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), civil rights leaders pledged to get to the bottom of what happened to Brown.

“We want this man arrested, in jail, and charged for murder,” the Rev James Stewart, the pastor of the church, said of the officer involved, to loud applause. The officer, who has been placed on paid leave, has not yet been publicly identified. He is expected to be named on Tuesday.

Describing the shooting as a “cankerous sore on the soul,” Cornell Brooks, the NAACP national president, told the packed church: “We owe it to this young man to seek justice.”

Brooks urged restraint from Ferguson’s young people after several stores were vandalised and looted during rioting late on Sunday. More than 30 people were arrested. “Martin Luther King did not live and die that we may steal in the name of justice in the middle of the night,” he said.

Dolly, the police spokesman, said officers had succeeded in protecting local businesses from a second round of thefts. Asked if they were anticipating more protests on Tuesday, he said: “We are not expecting it, but we will be prepared for it.”

Yet when asked how angry people remained, McMillan, the childhood friend of Brown, said: “They on 10. From one to 10, the anger level is 10. Because this is a peaceful protest, and they’re shooting us with smoke bombs and pellets.”

A few dozen police officers, some in military-style dress, remained at the makeshift police operation command centre late in a strip mall car park on Monday night, amid a sea almost 100 law-enforcement vehicles including two armoured Swat trucks.

A small group of officers congregating outside a branch of Target could be heard laughing and mocking the protesters they had been dealing with earlier in the night. “Oh, don’t shoot me!” one said, prompting hearty laughter.",193,1405,"Officer calls Ferguson, Missouri, a ‘war zone’ amid clashes between police and crowds angry over teenager’s death",NA

Guardian,guard53,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/16/barack-obama-ferguson-missouri-iraq-limits-of-power,The Observer view on Obama and the limits of presidential power,Observer editorial,08/16/14,04/13/16,"Six years ago, when Barack Obama ran for president, he did so on the back of two audacious claims – he would be the man to end the war in Iraq and he would heal the nation's glaring social and political divisions. Last week – in two disparate places, worlds apart, {Ferguson, Missouri,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/ferguson-police-michael-brown-robbery-suspect""> and Iraq's {Mount Sinjar}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/thousands-iraqi-refugees-still-risk-siege-mount-sinjar""> – Obama was reminded, once again, of how difficult it has been to keep his campaign trail promises.

While Obama was able to bring US troops home from Iraq, he, like so many recent US presidents, has been sucked into yet another conflict there – and has found himself prisoner to events on the ground that he can only marginally control.

The challenge of healing America's political and social division has run even deeper and been far less successful. According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Centre: ""Republicans and Democrats are more divided along ideological lines – and partisan antipathy is deeper and more extensive – than at any point in the last two decades.""

This mistrust is reshaping American politics and American governance. Politically engaged liberals and conservatives are more likely to see the other as threatening the ""nation's wellbeing""; they are more likely to prefer living among fellow ideologues and are less inclined to compromise. This polarisation and the refusal to reach across the aisle (a phenomenon, it must be said, exhibited almost exclusively by Republicans) explains much of the dysfunction in Washington today.

On the issue of race, which is America's original sin, the election of an African American president has not done nearly enough to improve race relations. By some accounts, Obama's victory made it worse. And last week's events in Ferguson are a reminder that the social inequities that challenge African Americans, from geographic segregation and economic inequality to police targeting and rampant bias, both conscious and unconscious, remain a pervasive element of US society.

All this might seem like the ultimate indictment of Obama's presidency. On the surface, it is an indication of how little he has been able to accomplish and how unfulfilled his promises remain, nearly six years into his presidency. There are plenty on the right – and some on the left – who have and will make just this charge. But, if anything, it should be a more pungent reminder of precisely how little power the US president actually enjoys and the extent to which he or she is constrained by forces far outside their control.

This might seem like a surprising conclusion, particularly when one considers the extraordinary pomp and circumstance that surround American presidents. Obama's every utterance and action is analysed to the minutest detail. When tragedies such as the shooting in Ferguson occur, no one looks to the speaker of the house to calm the nation. The next presidential election is more than two years away and already newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic are filled with speculation about Hillary Clinton and her potential Republican opponents. But this omnipresent focus on the presidency offers a distorted view of American politics.

To be sure, US presidents are far from powerless. They can issue executive orders and implement federal laws, often as they see fit. They can influence debates in Congress, drive national attention toward a specific policy agenda and, perhaps most importantly, begin wars in faraway lands.

But just because a US president can wield America's awesome military might to start wars doesn't mean they can necessarily end them satisfactorily. Even while occupying Iraq with more than 100,000 troops, the US could not force Iraqi leaders to bend to their will. Obama has dealt with similar frustrations in trying to handle Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, even as more than 1,000 US troops have died to help keep him in office.

If Obama wanted to send troops to Iraq to wipe out the Islamic State (and it's unlikely he does), he would face sizable domestic opposition; he would be distracted from his oft-expressed goal of focusing on ""nation-building"" at home and, above all, he would have little reason to believe that such an action would bring success. It was hard enough just to get Iraq's prime minister, {Nouri al-Maliki,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/iraqi-prime-minister-maliki-step-aside-abadi""> to surrender power, which happened last week, and only after Isis threatened more military gains.

At home, Obama can preach the message of unity over and over – he did it again, ironically, last week when commenting on the situation in Ferguson. But there is little reason to believe it would have a dramatic impact. Indeed, the more he talks about reconciliation and pushes his political priorities, the more likely he is to receive a negative response from Republican partisans, even if they agree with him on the specifics. The American ""bully pulpit"" is often described as a tool for rallying the country, but it can just as often be a tool for furthering divisions. Moreover, the US president can lay out his issue agenda, travel the country advocating for it, cajole members of Congress, and if the opposition party wants nothing to do with it, then the president has no lever to force them to do his bidding. That's one fact this president and his Democratic allies need no reminder of.

This is even truer on the issue of race, where the divides among whites and blacks are so ingrained that it would take a national exorcism to rid America of them. For all the millions who viewed Obama's election with great pride and believed that it signalled that the US was on the path to racial reconciliation, there was a significant minority that viewed Obama's win as a reason for trepidation and fear.

Obama played his part in forming the mythology that exists around America's highest office. In his inaugural bid for the White House, he fed sky-high expectations about what he could achieve as president; as things didn't work out as he and his supporters hoped, he is now trying feverishly to roll back that perception. But without raising such hopes – and if he had been more honest about the challenges that come with implementing ""hope and change"" – Obama would likely still be a member of the US Senate.

Obama's presidency has been anything but six years of missed opportunities. For the passage of healthcare reform alone, his legacy is clear. But if he can remind his fellow citizens of both the limits of US power and the folly of believing one man (or woman) can singlehandedly remake a nation of 300 million distinct souls, he would be doing a genuine service to both America and the world.",179,69,"After six years in the White House, and after last week's events in Missouri and Iraq, it's clear that one man can't change the world",NA

The FBI and US Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division have {opened}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/RobertDEdwards/status/499657337548701696""> an investigation into Brown’s death parallel to the St Louis County Police Department, even as multiple local law enforcement agencies have {turned Ferguson’s nights into something resembling a war zone.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/14/ferguson-cops-military-weapons-michael-brown-shooting-protests""> The FBI is also actively monitoring the investigation into Garner’s death, and several members of Congress {have requested a federal inquiry}<hyperlink=""http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/08/14/members-of-congress-seek-justice-probe-into-eric-garners-death/""> as {tensions remain high in New York.}<hyperlink=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/garner-march-moved-from-bridge-to-staten-island.html"">

These are good first steps at monitoring, but they are nowhere near enough to prevent abuses in law enforcement. How do we ensure this never happens again? How do we guarantee that no other mother will hear gunshots a block away, only to run and find her son or daughter laying unarmed at the feet of a police officer? That no father is held down by police until the life is choked out of him?

The US cannot continue to allow those duty-bound to protect its citizens – the FBI, state and local police, anyone – to become that which their community fears most. First, when use of force by the police has resulted in injury or death, a prompt, thorough, independent and truly impartial investigation must be conducted. Additionally, all officers responsible for abuses should be adequately disciplined and, where appropriate, prosecuted.

It is also imperative that both the {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdfs/Letter_to_Ferguson_Police_Department.pdf""> and New York police departments conduct mandatory retraining on the use of force – especially the use of deadly force. There can be no ambiguity about when a police officer is allowed to take a life. And right now, there is nothing but ambiguity in the death of Michael Brown. There is secrecy.

Some will remember when, in the early ’90s, it became public that the Chicago {Police}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk/police""> Department, under the command of Jon Burge, had tortured over 100 people of color – mostly African-American men – systemically over the course of decades.

The survivors of this brutality describe beatings and electric shocks, as well as having plastic bags pulled over their heads and threatened with mock executions. The subsequent forced confessions resulted in many individuals being sentenced to severe prison terms or, in some cases, death. Burge was {convicted}<hyperlink=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-06-28/news/ct-met-burge-trial-0629-20100628_1_burge-chicago-police-cmdr-special-cook-county-prosecutors""> of perjury and obstruction of justice, but neither he nor any of the detectives he supervised have, to this day, been prosecuted for their actions.

Our courts rarely impose serious penalties on law enforcement officers caught in even the most egregious violations of individuals’ rights. Our investigations of white police officers killing young black men too infrequently lead to independent conclusions. It’s ironic the United Nations is {reviewing the entire country’s record on racial discrimination}<hyperlink=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-racism-un-idUSKBN0GD1PH20140813""> this week.

The morning after demonstrators in Ferguson {reported being shot}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/michael-brown-shooting-ferguson-missouri-police-crack-down-protesters""> by what they called “wooden pellets”, the Guardian found three wooden rounds along the side of a street where clashes had taken place.

Asked to confirm that police had fired them at protesters, Brian Schellman, a spokesman for St Louis County police, said in an email on Tuesday morning: “Yes those are less lethal wooden baton rounds.”

Steve Walsh, 26, said that he was struck in the neck by a “wooden pellet” after becoming caught up in clashes while walking to the home of his two-month-old son, Saveon, and the child’s mother.

Walsh had a bloody, coin-sized wound behind his left ear. He appeared disoriented and drenched in sweat. “I almost fainted,” said Walsh. “Blood just started coming out. I was just walking through.”

Other demonstrators retreating from police said that they had seen others struck by the wooden rounds. “I saw a man get hit on the side of his face,” said Damon Bevly, 19, who works for a recycling company. “He had a fat bruise.”
On the same street on Tuesday morning were the remains of a Triple Chaser-branded CS gas canister and empty magazines for 60 Cal. Stinger 37mm rubber bullets.

Dozens of the rubber bullets were scattered around the street among some small rocks. Police said they used crowd control weapons against demonstrators after rocks were thrown at officers.

Police have not disclosed the name of the man who was killed, but family members say it was 18-year-old Michael Brown.

St Louis County police chief Jon Belmar said at a news conference that an officer encountered two people on the street near an apartment complex on Saturday afternoon in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St Louis.

Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and the struggle began. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer’s gun inside the police car.

The struggle spilled into the street, where one of the two people was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn’t known, but said: “It was more than just a couple.” He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer’s gun.

Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said the man who was shot was unarmed.

Jackson said police were in contact with the second person who was involved in the altercation, but that the person had not been arrested or charged and was expected to be interviewed later on Sunday. Authorities were not sure if the second person was unarmed, Jackson said.

During the news conference, which was held in a separate building, some protesters walked into the Ferguson Police Department chanting “Don’t shoot me” and holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase and stopped the crowd without using force.

Others outside shouted “We want answers” and “No justice, no peace”, and some carried signs saying “Stop police terrorism” and “Disarm the police”.

The St Louis County police are in charge of the investigation. On Saturday, John Gaskin, a member of the St Louis County NAACP, said the FBI should get involved “to protect the integrity of the investigation”. State Senator Jamilah Nasheed told the St Louis Post-Dispatch she would ask the US Justice Department on Monday for a formal investigation.

Gaskin alluded to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighbourhood watch organiser who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, as well as the New York man who died from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes.

“With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers … this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,” Gaskin said.

Belmar said the officer has been with the Ferguson police department for six years and he wasn’t aware of other issues involving the man. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is a common procedure after officer-involved shootings.

After the news conference, several protesters yelled at the officers who surrounded the crowd.

“I don’t want you killing my child just because he walked out the door,” Shontell Walters, of Ferguson, said.

Brown’s grandmother, Desiree Harris, said on Saturday she saw him in her neighbourhood and minutes later, heard a commotion and went outside. She found Brown’s body less than two blocks away.

“My grandson never even got into a fight,” she said of Brown, who she added had recently graduated high school. “He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way.”

Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, had harsh words for authorities.

“You’re not God, you don’t get to decide when you get to take somebody from here,” she told KSDK.",104,1027,"• Michael Brown, 18, confirmed to have been unarmed

Hundreds of protestors attended a rally outside the Ferguson police station demanding murder charges be brought against the officer who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown.

The circumstances of Brown’s death are still unclear and very much in dispute. St Louis County police chief Jon Belmar said an autopsy indicated the teen had been struck multiple times by gunfire.

Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said her son had recently graduated high school and was looking forward to starting college classes.

“We can’t even celebrate. We’ve got to plan a funeral,” she said during a press conference on Monday. McSpadden, very shaken, continued to shake her head in disbelief and as she quietly repeated: “He didn’t deserve this.” 

There are conflicting accounts of the events that led to Brown’s death. Authorities have said Brown got into an altercation with an officer but a {witness}<hyperlink=""http://www.walb.com/story/26242217/friend-describes-how-teen-was-killed-by-police""> said there was no scuffle and Brown was shot as he raised his hands to show he was unarmed.

After the shooting, Brown’s body was {left}<hyperlink=""http://www.walb.com/story/26244265/police-missouri-teen-allegedly-assaulted-officer-before-shooting""> bleeding and lifeless in the streets for hours. Authorities said they would look into why the body’s removal was delayed.

Brown’s family has hired civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, the same lawyer who represented the family of Trayvon Martin.

Crump urged authorities to conduct a swift and transparent investigation.

“Don’t make us wait forever because the pot will continue to boil,” he said during a press conference. He made clear that the family “rejects” the police’s account of the incident, and is asking witnesses to come forward with statements, videos or photos.

The St Louis County police and the FBI are conducting concurrent investigations into the shooting, authorities said Monday.

US attorney general Eric Holder said in a statement on Monday that FBI agents from the St Louis field office would work together with attorneys from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and US Attorney’s Office to conduct a “fulsome review” of the incident.

Brown’s death sparked overnight looting and vandalism in the St Louis suburb after a vigil for the teen turned violent. Police said two dozens businesses had been damaged in the riots, 32 people arrested, and two officers injured.

[tweetbegin 498919074148397056 tweetend]

By Monday, the rage had ebbed but the anger still pulsed.

“People are angry, people are hurt, people are fed up. You have to direct it somewhere – and you can’t direct it at the people who made you angry because they’ll shoot you and kill you,” Derek Laney, 49, of St Louis told a Los Angeles Times reporter in Ferguson. “So they express it outward … I wouldn’t go out and smash things, I wouldn’t go out and burn things. But I understand why people do it.”

Speaking to the St Louis Post-Dispatch, DeAndrew Smith, 30, compared Brown’s death to the death of Martin, the 17-year-old Florida teenager who was shot and killed while walking home from the store.

“You ain’t got to kill him,” Smith said. “He ain’t got a gun in his hands. Why did you kill him? You said {Trayvon}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/28/trayvon-martin-florida-statehouse-stand-your-ground""> had a hoodie on. You didn’t know what was going on with him. He didn’t have no hoodie on. His hands was up when you shot him. So what’s your excuse?”

Some carried signs that read “We are Michael Brown,” an homage to the rallying cry protestors used after Martin’s death.

Social media exploded in reaction to news of Brown’s death in what’s becoming a ritual following such incidents.

The hashtag #{iftheygunnedmedown}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/IfTheyGunnedMeDown?src=hash""> emerged, asking viewers which photo would be published if they were to be shot by police.

On Youtube, the hacker collective Anonymous published a video encouraging Ferguson residents to demand justice for Brown’s death.

""To the good people of Ferguson, take heart and take your streets. You are not alone, we will support you in every way possible. Occupy every square inch of your city. Demand justice. Staying silent today could result in the death of your kid tomorrow.""

Anonymous demanded that Missouri congressmen introduce “Mike Brown’s Law”, a bill that sets strict national standards for police conduct. It threatened to publish officers personal information if any protestors are harmed.

Brown’s family has asked for an end to the street violence, according to a statement obtained by KTVI television station.

Monday’s gathering appeared nonviolent, with protesters shouting “Stop the killer cops” and “No justice, no peace.” Four people were arrested, according to KSDK-TV.

Police said Brown was shot on Saturday afternoon after a struggle over a gun in a police car. It was not immediately clear why Brown was in the car. At least one shot was fired during the struggle, and then the officer fired more shots before leaving the car.

Guardian,guard59,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/what-is-national-guard-ferguson-missouri,What is the US national guard and when is it called up?,Lauren Gambino,08/18/14,04/18/16,"On Sunday night, the streets of Ferguson descended into violent chaos, prompting the governor to {deploy}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-michael-brown-national-guard-deployed""> the Missouri national guard. Governor Jay Nixon, who acts as commander-in-chief of his state’s national guard, said the troops are {needed}<hyperlink=""https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/following-coordinated-attacks-civilians-and-law-enforcement-governor-nixon-signs""> to restore peace and order in the northern St Louis suburb.

What is the national guard?
Each state, Washington DC and US territories has a national guard, and serve a dual state and federal mission.

It is first and foremost a state agency, but units can be mobilised by the US president to assist the country’s armed forces. States’ national guard units often receive federal funding and training.

All states have an air national guard and an army national guard. The forces are organised by units that can include military, medical, aviation and engineering, among others. The governor serves as commander-in-chief.

In general, guard soldiers hold civilian jobs and live at home. They have a drill commitment one weekend per month and are required to attend one two-week training each year.

The governor is not required to notify the US president of the administration before calling the national guard into service.

When is it called up?
Under state law, the national guard may be activated by governors – as Nixon has done in {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> – to respond to domestic emergencies such as natural disasters and civil disturbances.

National guard forces are most often called in to assist with natural disasters as Missouri did after a catastrophic tornado ripped through the city of Joplin in 2011.

Jim Craig, an associate professor of military and veteran studies at the University of Missouri-St Louis, said deploying the state national guard to quell civil unrest is less common.

“Calling out the national guard for a flood is one thing, calling out the national guard for riots and unrest moves way into the extreme,” Craig said.

Texas governor Rick Perry has {sent}<hyperlink=""http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/military/article/Perry-at-Camp-Swift-as-guard-trains-for-border-5686180.php""> roughly 1,000 army national guard troops to the US-Mexico border where thousands of unaccompanied Central American children are entering the country. The troops will aid the state’s department of public safety with a border-security mission.

National guard personnel can be ordered to active duty by the federal government to serve in overseas missions. They can be called to duty voluntarily or ordered under other specific circumstances.

For example, Craig said some Missouri national guard engineers are currently serving in Afghanistan.

State v federal duty
The key differences between national guard troops being ordered to active duty by the state, and their deployment by the federal government, are who foots the bill and who’s in control.

When units are called up to serve in overseas combat missions, for example, the personnel are federally funded and under federal command and control.

In other situations, national guard personnel can be federally funded to perform certain duties but remain under state control. This happened during hurricane Katrina as well as during Obama’s 2009 inauguration.

When a state deploys the national guard, the state pays and the soldiers report to the governor.

The national guard and race relations
The national guard has been deployed to maintain control during some key racially fuelled events in US history.

In 1957 and 1958, the Arkansas governor ordered the state national guard to prevent black enrollments at a public high school.

In 1965, President Lyndon B Johnson federalized the Alabama national guard after images of state troopers beating peaceful civil rights protestors marching from Selma to Montgomery sparked outrage.

In 1968, they were deployed during the riots that lit up across the country in wake of the assassination of the civil rights leader, Martin Luther King.

In 1992 California national guard forces were called in to regain control of Los Angeles after riots erupted when four white officers were acquitted of severely beating a black man, Rodney King. President George HW Bush then declared it a federal disaster area and called the guard into federal service. More than 50 people died and nearly 2,000 people were injured before the troops eventually quelled the situation.

Craig questioned whether the presence of the national guard would be effective in Ferguson. “The National Guard by design is militarised, and so that doesn’t theoretically de-escalate the situation. It actually may change the dynamic.”",NA,168,"Governor Jay Nixon deployed the Missouri national guard to help quell violence in Ferguson, after chaos erupted on Sunday night",NA

We cannot stay silent,Al Sharpton,08/15/14,04/20/16,"There are certain phone calls I dread receiving. It’s the call of a crying mother or father pleading for help because their son or daughter has been killed by those who were supposed to serve and protect them. Several weeks ago, I received one such phone call when an unarmed father of six in Staten Island, New York, was placed in an apparently illegal police chokehold according to videotape capturing the horrific incident. He, Eric Garner, died after repeatedly stating “I can’t breathe”; the city medical examiner later ruled his death a homicide.

Last weekend, as I was preparing for an {upcoming march}<hyperlink=""http://www.ny1.com/content/news/213625/sharpton-announces-changes-to--we-will-not-go-back--rally-in-garner-s-memory/""> to demand justice for Garner’s family, I received yet another disturbing call. This time, it was from a man in Ferguson, Missouri, who told me about his grandson, 18-year-old Michael Brown. Brown was supposed to begin college this week; instead, he was shot dead by police. He was also unarmed and, according to several eyewitness accounts, had his arms raised in the air to show that he had no weapon. Many news outlets have even stated that his body remained in the street for several hours after he was killed.

As a society, we’d like to think these incidents are few and far between, but as a black American who has worked to advance civil rights for all, I can tell you that nothing could be further from the truth. I can cite case after case of police brutality and excessive force resulting in the deaths of countless men and women. Most of these cases don’t gain prominence on a national level, let alone an international one.

It is 15 years since 23-year-old Amadou Diallo was killed outside his Bronx apartment building when four officers fired a total of 41 shots at him. He was unarmed. His mother and others reached out to my organisation, National Action Network (NAN), for assistance. Despite our efforts, and despite the efforts of many, the officers responsible were all acquitted. In 2006, another unarmed 23-year-old, Sean Bell, was killed the night before his wedding after NYPD officers fired 50 bullets at him and his friends. Timothy Stansbury, 19, was killed in 2004 in Brooklyn, New York, after an officer said he fired by accident. In 2009, a transit cop in Oakland shot and killed Oscar Grant, 22, as he lay face down on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back. The officer said he meant to use his Taser but reached for his gun by mistake.

Many of these cases I have been involved with personally. They highlight an ugly pattern from coast to coast. There are just far too many occurrences of mistakes, accidents and other excuses that have all resulted in one thing – dead unarmed people of colour.

We must address this crisis immediately. We cannot deem an entire segment of the population guilty until proven innocent.

Not all police officers are bad; in fact, the majority are not. But when the bad ones are not held accountable for their actions, it sends a chilling message to the communities they serve. We need our young black men and women to know that their lives matter, that they cannot be gunned down like animals. When cops don’t live in the neighbourhoods they serve, they don’t know how to properly police the area. They then dehumanise an entire group of people by harassing, profiling and, in terrible instances like that of Michael Brown, killing the unarmed.

In the town of Ferguson, most of the population is black, but almost all of its police department is white; 92% of searches and 86% of car stops in Ferguson in 2013 involved black people according to statistics in a recent piece in Mother Jones magazine.

We must stop criminalising minority groups. We must replace the bad apples with police who truly care about serving and protecting us. Knowing the name of an officer accused of killing an unarmed person is not enough; that officer must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

We have fought too long and too hard to eliminate the wounds of racism and prejudice just to watch things regress. Until black people no longer have to fear both the cops and robbers, until we reform policing tactics everywhere, we cannot stay silent. For if we do, we will continue to read headlines like this: Black, unarmed and dead.",304,0,It’s not enough to know the name of the officer involved in the Ferguson killing.

Guardian,guard61,http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/aug/17/police-guns-detroit-crime-race-cost-issues,Police tell Detroiters to buy guns in city riven by race issues and crime,Rose Hackman,08/17/14,04/20/16,"{Detroit}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/detroit""> police chief James Craig – nicknamed “Hollywood” for his years spent in the LAPD and his seeming love of being in front of the camera – has repeatedly called on “good” and “law-abiding” Detroiters to arm themselves against criminals in the city.

His words have not fallen on deaf ears.

Patricia Champion, a 63-year-old lifelong Detroiter, a grandmother and retired educator, decided to get her concealed pistol license - a CPL - two years ago after her son said he was increasingly worried for her safety. Champion, a resident of northwest Detroit, mostly keeps her gun, a 9mm Glock 19 that set her back $600, in her house.

“That’s why I got it: because I’m going to be in the house. Now, if somebody chooses to come in and I didn’t invite you, between the Glock and the dog, you’re gone. If one doesn’t get you, the other one will.”

“The police are not going to protect you when something is being perpetrated on you. They may turn up after the fact and run after that person, but you have to protect yourself,” Champion says.

Champion’s fears of facing a threat in her home are not ill-founded. Besides having the worst homicide rate among large American cities, Detroit experienced 12,935 burglaries last year. With around 250,000 households, that means Detroiters have roughly a 1 in 20 chance of being burgled. To residents who have been victims of crime, being allowed to carry a weapon, whether openly or concealed, is not just reassuring, it’s part of the pragmatic reality of living in the Motor City. Wayne County, which encapsulates Detroit and its metro area, counted 83,950 active concealed-pistol permits as of 1 August 2014 – meaning one permit for every 21 households.

The city, strapped for cash, has only 2,300 police officers – unchanged from a year ago, before the bankruptcy, but still not enough. Many Detroiters feel they have to rely on themselves first for their own security and survival.

For Rick Ector, a Detroit-based NRA firearms instructor and former Chrysler systems analyst, it is quite simple: “You are your own first line of defense.”

But that’s not without conflict. This week, {police chased and shot two men}<hyperlink=""http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140814/METRO01/308140062/Detroit-police-urging-calm-after-cops-shoot-suspect-unruly-crowd-gathers""> after allegedly seeing them illegally purchasing a gun. Coincident with the civil {unrest in Ferguson, Missouri,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/ferguson-police-darren-wilson-michael-brown-shooting""> it added another layer of tension to a city already high-strung about guns and crime. 

An additional cost of living in Detroit: firearms
In a city where {houses sometimes sell for $500,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/nov/05/young-people-detroit-buy-500-house""> buying and maintaining a gun is a significant expense. For those who choose to earn concealed pistol licenses, like Champion, the application fee is $105 and courses might set you back anywhere between $100 and $250. Purchased guns cost interviewees of this story between $450 and $700, with accessories; including ammunition, add another possible $200-$300.

“A good investment,”the retired grandmother says.

“There’s a lot of stuff going on around here. We watch the news, and every day it’s something,” says 37-year-old Tanisha Moner, a former hospital administrator. 

When Moner was 17, she was raped and robbed at gunpoint at a pay phone in Detroit. Four years later, 21-year-old Moner was attending Wayne State University in the city and working as a manager at a Burger King on the side. One morning, while she was counting money in her Burger King office, she was once again robbed at gunpoint and left in the fast-food restaurant’s freezer. After that, Moner says she became petrified of guns and loud noises.

“Finally, two years ago I said, I’m either going to let my fear overcome me, or I am going to beat my fear. So I got my [concealed pistol license] in the event that something else should ever happen.”

Moner carries her $650 fourth-generation Glock 19 most places she goes. 

The ‘shoot-first’ law
And if, as in the case of Patricia Champion, Detroit residents plan on resisting criminals, the law is theoretically on their side.

{Michigan}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michigan""> passed a self-defense act in 2006, referred to nationally as a “stand-your-ground-law”. The law removes an individual’s duty, when acting in self-defense, to retreat. 

Instead, it allows individuals who have an “honest and reasonable belief” that they are in imminent fear for their life, serious bodily harm or sexual assault to use deadly force.

Skeptics have called this a “shoot-first” law.

As in the case of Florida’s “stand your ground” law, Michigan’s no-duty-to-retreat law takes the age-old “castle doctrine”, originally conceived to be applicable to people in their own homes, to the next level: people can shoot and “stand their ground” anywhere they have the “legal right to be” – from a car parking lot, to a supermarket, to a home.

More to the point perhaps, in Detroit where citizens are constantly on-guard, the self-defense act also allows for the use of deadly force when an individual “reasonably and honestly” believes the “unlawful use of force” is about to be used on them or another individual.

Last November, Renisha McBride, a 19-year-old, unarmed black teenager from Detroit, was wordlessly {shot dead by white Theodore Wafer}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/renisha-mcbride-trial-detroit-self-defense-wafer""> on the porch of his home in the nearby suburb of Dearborn Heights, as she was apparently seeking help after being in a car accident in the early hours of the morning.

And although Wafer was recently {found guilty of second-degree murder,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/detroit-man-guilty-renisha-mcbride-shooting""> intrinsic to his defense and the justification of his acts was the notion that being close to Detroit warranted being armed and fearful. 

He was, like many Detroit residents, ready to expect the worst when someone came banging at his door. In her concluding remarks to the jury, Wafer’s defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter quoted police chief Craig encouraging Detroiters to bear arms.

While anyone over 18 who legally purchases a gun can openly carry it in Michigan – meaning the gun should be visible at all times – the process is lengthier to get a permit for conceal-and-carry, or keeping a gun without it being visible. You must get your concealed pistol license, or CPL, which involves an eight-hour mandatory training class and an application with the Wayne County Clerk.

But motivations to own and learn how to use guns are not just tied to a high crime rate in Detroit, which made international headlines last year for being the {largest American city to ever file for bankruptcy.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/18/detroit-formally-files-bankruptcy"">

Legally armed in Detroit: guns and racial bias
At annual NRA national meetings, Detroiter Rick Ector finds himself to be an exception: among thousands of participants, he is one of the only black people in the room. 

In 2006, Ector, a self-described family man who was ambivalent about guns and saw no need to own one, was carjacked at gunpoint in his driveway in the North Rosedale Park area of Detroit. Today, his belief in the importance of carrying has reached such a degree he teaches classes, leads a volunteer effort to empower women to use guns and writes a blog called LAID, or Legally Armed In Detroit.

Indeed, if it is an anomaly for a police chief to go on record and speak in favor of his citizens arming themselves against criminals, what might strike some as more noteworthy within the current national climate of racially tense shootings is that Detroit is 82% black. The police-sanctioned arms race stacking so-called “good” Detroiters against presumably bad ones may be fulfilling a stigma of armed black people, rather than trying to dismantle it.

The potential legal consequences of the city’s racial makeup should not be underestimated, says Mark Fancher, a racial justice staff attorney at Michigan’s ACLU.

While Craig likes to cite an armed populace as being a deterrent to crime, Fancher says it is worth considering how stand-your-ground laws statistically tend to help protect white shooters over black ones.

Implicit in Craig’s statements and residents’ understanding of those statements is that should good Detroiters shoot, they would be in the right, protected by the law.

But in a 2013 study analyzing FBI data and stand-your-ground laws across the United States, John Roman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, found that stand-your-ground laws in practice disproportionately protected white shooters, and held black shooters – regardless of race of the person they’ve shot – more likely to be found guilty.

The starkest of differences was found between cross-racial shootings. A white shooter of a black victim is 10 times more likely to have his or her homicide ruled justified compared to the homicide of a black shooter on a white victim.

These differences are so strong that it is almost impossible to conclude racial bias does not play a role, says Roman the author of the study, who is also executive director at the District of Columbia Crime Policy Institute.

Despite numerous reports in the local media of residents shooting home invaders and carjackers since the beginning of the year, only eight homicides have so far been ruled justified, says sergeant Michael Woody, a Detroit Police Department spokesperson.

One of those reported shootings involved Divana Webb’s son, 15-year-old Damontae Moorer, who was shot four times this April while allegedly breaking into a man’s house with a 19-year-old woman. 

Moorer, whose mother says he was unarmed at the time and was brought up away from guns, died at the scene. The prosecutor’s office has not yet ruled whether the homicide was justified.

“The idea of putting deadly force into the hands of untrained citizens as a strategy to reduce violence strikes me as something that can only be counter-productive,” says Roman, referring to this unique kind of policing as an “arm yourself and fire-at-will model”. 

From an economic development perspective, the ramifications of this kind of policy are mixed, once more with potential differences along racial lines.

Police proactively patrol the whiter areas of Detroit – downtown, midtown, Corktown and Eastern Market – with their presence felt to a much lesser degree in other neighborhoods of the city predominately lived in by African Americans.

Moreover, downtown peacekeeping is supplemented by private security financed by downtown’s businesses – notably Rock Ventures and Quicken Loans, both owned by billionaire Dan Gilbert. Midtown peacekeeping is heavily supplemented by Wayne State University Police, whose response time is famously just 90 seconds. Residents of Midtown do not feel the same urgency to arm themselves as residents in other, less central parts of the city.

Regarding economic consequences for the city, Roman’s words are unforgiving.

“I think it’s a disaster. How do you grow a city when you say to people who are thinking about moving there: ‘When you move here, bring a weapon.’ Who’s going to want to move there?”

What residents are finding, in Detroit, is that the cost of owning a gun is far more than the money it takes to buy one. ",859,0,City police chief has encouraged residents to arm themselves as stark racial disparities in ‘shoot first’ laws become clear,NA

Director: Ryan Coogler
Entertainment grade: A–
History grade: A–

On New Year's Day 2009, an unarmed African-American man called Oscar Grant III was fatally shot by transport police at Fruitvale station on San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. The shooting was filmed by several bystanders on their mobile phones. The incident sparked protests, some violent.

Context
Many historical films deal with grand events, like wars or revolutions. Fruitvale Station is a quiet, unassuming story about the shooting of one ordinary man. In context, though, it is part of a significant historical story. It is estimated that {one in three black men in the US today will be incarcerated}<hyperlink=""http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet""> at some point in their lifetimes; a report by {one activist organisation}<hyperlink=""http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/1-black-man-killed-every-28-hours-police-or-vigilantes-america-perpetually-war-its""> has claimed that a black man was killed by police, security guards or self-appointed vigilantes every 28 hours in 2012. Fruitvale Station was released in July 2013 – coincidentally, just as George Zimmerman was {acquitted of murdering black teenager Trayvon Martin.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/14/open-season-black-boys-verdict"">

Fruitvale Station feels all too relevant again this week. Protests in Ferguson, Missouri have been met with an {extraordinary police crackdown}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-teargas-rubber-bullets-michael-brown""> after unarmed teenager Michael Brown was fatally shot by police on Saturday. Other cases have also made headlines in the last few days. John Crawford, a father of two, was {fatally shot at a supermarket in Ohio}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/ohio-walmart-man-fatally-shot-store-video""> by police while holding an air rifle. Ezell Ford was {fatally shot by police in Los Angeles}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/us/man-shot-and-killed-by-los-angeles-police-officer.html?_r=0"">; he was unarmed and reportedly suffered from a mental illness. Though Fruitvale Station focuses on just one story, it relates to a much wider narrative.

People
Fruitvale Station opens with real cameraphone footage of the events of 1 January 2009, then flashes back to explore the final day in the life of 22-year-old Oscar Grant (played with superb realism by Michael B Jordan, previously seen in The Wire and Friday Night Lights). Though dramatic licence has been used in the reconstruction of these events, the facts are straight. Grant had recently been fired from his supermarket job; he had a girlfriend (played by Melonie Diaz, also excellent) and daughter; his past included selling drugs and spending time in prison. {Accusations that the film makes him simplistically heroic}<hyperlink=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kylesmith/2013/07/25/fruitvale-station-is-loose-with-the-facts-in-an-effort-to-elicit-sympathy-for-oscar-grant/""> are absurd. Grant is shown to be a complicated character, whose thoughtfulness and kindness are balanced by a too quick and sometimes uncontrollable temper (taken out on his mother and his ex-boss) and a tendency to lie (he has cheated on his girlfriend, and pretends he hasn't lost his job).

Invention
There is only one scene which might reasonably be said to go a bit far in making Grant sympathetic, in which he comforts a dog after an accident. {The scene is fictional.}<hyperlink=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/12/ryan-coogler-fruitvale-station_n_3580960.html#slide=2014937""> Some viewers have found it too manipulative. It is unlikely to trouble historians, though. While it might make a slight difference to viewers' perceptions of Grant, it's hardly a historical travesty on the level of, say, {setting a film in the wrong era with the wrong people}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/06/periodandhistorical-melgibson""> (Apocalypto), {attributing a major wartime breakthrough to the wrong nation}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/25/u-571-reel-history""> (U-571) or viciously {slandering everyone in the 16th century}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/03/anonymous-shakespeare-reel-history""> (Anonymous).

Violence
The film builds towards its crucial final scene at Fruitvale Station. There is a fight on the train, and the BART police arrive. Though the events on the platform were filmed by several people present, the exact details remain controversial – and the film does not use the real names of the police officers involved. {One video}<hyperlink=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Video-shows-another-BART-cop-hitting-passenger-3175189.php""> has been said to show an officer striking one of the detained men, identified by some as Grant; the officer's attorney {disputed that analysis.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Protesters-Push-for-Charges-Against-Second-BART-Police-Officer.html""> Grant was shot in the back by Officer Johannes Mehserle. Mehserle's defence argued that he mistook his gun for his taser. The jury convicted him of involuntary manslaughter – a lesser charge than the second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter options that the judge had also offered. The film depicts the scene as confusing. Its focus is on the impact on Grant's family and friends, not on what the officers thought or did.

Verdict
{Fruitvale Station}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/film/fruitvale-station""> is a fair portrait of Oscar Grant's story, and a brilliant portrait of how lack of opportunity, routine incarceration and racism conspire to devalue the lives of young black men in America.",4,0,"This brilliant film sticks closely to the known facts about one unlawful killing in 2009, but is part of a wider, ever relevant story about the treatment of young black men in America ",NA
Guardian,guard63,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/17/james-risen-obama-greatest-enemy-press-freedom-generation,James Risen calls Obama 'greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation',Joanna Walters,08/17/14,04/20/16,"The New York Times reporter {James Risen, who faces jail}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/13/obama-administration-jail-james-risen""> over his refusal to reveal a source and testify against a former CIA agent accused of leaking secrets, has called President Barack Obama “the greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation”.

{Speaking to his colleague Maureen Dowd,}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-wheres-the-justice-at-justice.html?_r=0""> Risen accused the president of aggressively pursuing journalists, including himself, who report sensitive stories that reflect poorly on the US government.

Risen faces jail over his reporting of a botched intelligence operation that ended up spilling nuclear secrets to Iran. The Justice Department has long been seeking to force him to testify and name the confidential source of the account, which is contained in his 2006 book State of War.

Risen recently failed in an attempt to have {the supreme court}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/02/supreme-court-declines-review-reporter-james-risen-source-nyt""> review an order for him to testify, and acknowledges that he has exhausted all his legal options against the Justice Department’s pursuit of him under the controversial Espionage Act. In the face of incarceration that could come as early as this autumn, he is resorting instead to journalistic defiance.

Risen would be the first journalist to go to prison for failing to divulge sources since 2005, when the former New York Times reporter Judith Miller was {jailed for contempt of court,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jul/07/pressandpublishing.usnews""> after refusing to testify about a source before a federal grand jury.

“I was nervous for a long time, but they’ve been after me for six years so now I try to ignore it,” Risen told Dowd.

The pursuit of Risen began under the administration of President George W Bush. The Justice Department tried to prosecute him under the {Espionage}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/espionage""> Act for his 2006 Pulitzer Prize-winning scoop about the illegal wiretapping of American citizens after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. It also targeted him for the revelations in State of War.

The Bush administration arrested Jeffrey Sterling, whom Dowd on Sunday referred to as a “disillusioned” former CIA operative, and accused him of being the source of Risen’s leak about Iran. The {Obama administration}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/obama-administration""> continues to attempt to force Risen to testify against Sterling and name him as his main source.

Risen is furious at statements from the likes of Obama and the attorney general, Eric Holder, about supporting press freedom – including condemnation of the police in Ferguson, Missouri, for this week {arresting journalists reporting on riots there.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/obama-ferguson-police-excessive-force-michael-brown"">

Obama and Holder said journalists should not be arrested or harassed for doing their jobs and covering “a story that needs to be told”. In May, Holder said of the Sterling case: “No reporter who is doing his job is going to go to jail.” Risen, however, could be behind bars within weeks.

Dowd asked Risen how the Obama administration could use the Espionage Act to imprison reporters and whistleblowers while not acting on the acknowledged {use of torture by the CIA on terrorism suspects}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/obama-cia-torture-some-folks-brennan-spying""> and the same agency spying on the US Senate.

“It’s hypocritical,” Risen said. “A lot of people still think this is some kind of game or signal or spin. They don’t want to believe that Obama wants to crack down on the press and whistleblowers. But he does. He’s the greatest enemy to press freedom in a generation.”

Last week, groups campaigning for press freedom handed a petition with more than 100,000 signatures to the Justice Department, urging it to drop the case against Risen.

Guardian,guard64,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/17/israeli-ship-remains-at-sea-thousands-protesters-gather,Israeli ship remains at sea as thousands of protesters gather in Oakland,Rebecca Bowe,08/17/14,04/20/16,"An Israeli ship subject of a pro-Palestinian protest has docked, but demonstrations at the port of Oakland in {California}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california""> continue after between 2,000 and 3,000 pro-Palestinian activists streamed towards the port entrance on Saturday, chanting and waving flags. It remains unclear whether the ship’s cargo has been unloaded.

The protesters intended to form a picket line to prevent work crews from unloading the ship.

Activists had originally planned to meet at 5am for a blockade of the Zim Integrated Shipping Services vessel, but word that its arrival had been delayed prompted organisers to push the protest back until later in the afternoon.

The event began with a brief rally at a nearby transit station, folowed by a march to the port. Sameh Ayesh, a 21-year-old Palestinian activist with the San Francisco-based Arab Youth Organisation, led the crowd in a chant.

“We’re gonna block the boat,” he called into a megaphone. “Block, block the boat.”

But before the march had even reached the port entrance, an activist who identified himself as Eyad delivered word that the Zim vessel would not be docking that day. An online ship tracking service showed that the vessel was off the coast of California, closer to Santa Cruz, as the march got under way.

Activists interpreted the delay as a victory, viewing the schedule as having been made in response to the planned pickets. “We have stopped the Zim Piraeus from docking on the west coast of the United States,” said Eyad, of the Arab Resource and Organising Center (Aroc), into a megaphone, drawing cheers from the crowd as the march came to a halt on a bridge leading towards the docks.

A spokeswoman for the pot of Oakland, Marilyn Sandifur, declined to comment on the protest but disputed the Guardian's estimate of crowd numbers, saying that the port and local police believed the figure to be closer to 500. Zim, the shipping company, did not respond to a request for comment.

""Zim Lines is the largest Israeli shipping company, and it's a huge flow of capital for the state of {Israel}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel"">,” said Lara Kiswani, executive director of the Arab Resource and Organising Center, one of 70 groups to take part in planning the blockade.

Kiswani said the action was meant to generate momentum for a broader campaign calling for boycott, divestment and sactions aginst the Israeli government as a response to violence in {Gaza.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza""> “With the recent attacks on Palestine … there’s been a lot of discussion locally, particularly with Aroc, on how to escalate our tactics,” she said.

A similar blockade against a Zim vessel took place in 2010, when pro-Palestinian activists formed picket lines in respone to Isreal's attack on a flotilla ferrying humanitarian outreach workers to Gaza. “After the flotilla was attacked by the state of Israel, we successfully were able to block the Zim Lines ship here, with the ILWU,” Kiswani said. “So for years we were working with ILWU, with rank and file, and with the leadership, to try and raise awareness about the plight of Palestinians.” In 1984, she added, “ILWU took a position against apartheid, and the workers refused to unload that ship”.

As the march reached the port entrance, where activists had origianlly planned to stage a picket, they eencountered a line of police officers standing in formation. Protesters erupted into chants of, “hands up, don’t shoot!” – echoing chants sounded in response to police violence directed against street protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, in the wake of the fatal police shotting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Several others made statements linking recent acts of police brutality wtih the conflict in Gaza. “On Twitter, we’ve seen people in Gaza tweet to protesters in Ferguson how to cope with teargas,” said Mohamed Shehk, who helped organise the blockade with the Oakland=based nonprofit Critical Resistance. “They’re saying things like, ‘as Palestinians, we know what it’s like to be targeted and killed for being of the wrong ethnicity’.” ",NA,0,"Blockade delayed as word spreads that ship is off the coast of California, closer to Santa Cruz, and won’t be docking that day",NA

Egypt massacre last year was premeditated, rights group says
In what became one of the bloodiest days in modern history, Egyptian security forces intentionally killed at least 817 protesters in Rabaa a year ago, according to a Human Rights Watch report. The killings were reminiscent of the 1989 Tiananmen Square killings in China: they were systematic, widespread and “probably amount to crimes against humanity”. 

It recommended that several senior individuals, including President {Abdel Fatah al-Sisi,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/22/abdel-fatah-al-sisi-egypt-president""> are investigated and held to account for their role in planning the massacre, which occurred in August 2013 during the dispersal of {a six-week-old encampment in Cairo’s}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/12/egypt-cairo-mohamed-morsi-camps""> Al-Adawiya Square, set up by demonstrators protesting the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi. The report states that the camp’s estimated 85,000 protesters were not given enough time to leave before troops started firing and were prevented for from leaving via safe exits.

Speaking to the Guardian, 61-year-old former oil worker Hussein Abdel Aal said he had witnessed his son Ramzy being shot dead by a sniper. He said Ramzy was standing far from the edge of the camp and “did not have any kind of weapons. From the stick to the gun, he had nothing.”

Humans talks of 'real chance' for Gaza agreement with Israel
After a five-week-long war in Gaza, {mediators in Cairo brokered a five-day extension to the current ceasefire shortly before a midnight deadline on Wednesday.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/gaza-conflict-israel-hamas-extend-ceasefire"">

Efforts to extend the truce went to the wire and Hamas, the Islamist organisation in power in Gaza, said it believed there was a “real opportunity” to reach an agreement with {Israel}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel""> to end the conflict in Gaza. 

{Hamas}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas""> negotiator Khalil al-Hayya told reporters: “There is still a real chance to clinch an agreement, but Israel must stop playing with words.” He added: “We are not interested in more destruction for our people. We are not interested in more bloodshed.”

Egyptian mediators appeared to be striving for a two-part agreement:

1) Easing Israeli restrictions on imports and exports, increasing the number of permits issued to Gazans to enter or travel through Israel, reducing the size of the no-go “buffer zone” inside Gaza’s perimeter, and expanding the permitted fishing zone.

2) To follow some weeks later, a focus on Hamas’s demands for a sea and airport, and the possible release of some Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed in the conflict which Hamas is believed to be holding as a bargaining tool.

Hamas also wants the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt to be opened, possibly policed by Palestinian Authority security forces.

Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade since 2006 that has sent unemployment and poverty soaring.

Russian military vehicles enter Ukraine as aid convoy stops short

The {Guardian’s Shaun Walker reports}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/russian-military-vehicles-enter-ukraine-aid-convoy-stops-short-border"">:

""After pausing by the side of the road until nightfall, the convoy crossed into Ukrainian territory, using a rough dirt track and clearly crossing through a gap in a barbed wire fence that demarcates the border. Armed men were visible in the gloom by the border fence as the column moved into Ukraine. Kiev has lost control of its side of the border in this area.
The trucks are unlikely to represent a full-scale official Russian invasion, and it was unclear how far they planned to travel inside Ukrainian territory and how long they would stay. But it was incontrovertible evidence of what Ukraine has long claimed – that Russian troops are active inside its borders.”

Walker also tweeted a photo:

However in Kiev’s view, the convoy is at best a cynical ploy and at worst, a kind of Trojan centipede. The armoured vehicles seen by the Guardian are further evidence of Russia’s incursions, which the Kremlin has repeatedly denied

Sharks take a bite out of Google

Calm descends over Ferguson after four nights of violence
Thursday evening saw {reduced clashes in the small suburb of Ferguson, Missouri,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/ferguson-disarming-tactics-of-highway-patrol-pay-dividends-as-calm-descends""> over the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown and subsequent claims of police brutality toward African-Americans.

The initial operation – this included highly militarised police officers reportedly throwing tear gas and firing rubber bullets at the largely unarmed protesters, the shutting down of roads leading into the city and the implementation of a no-fly Zone – was replaced on the demand of the state governor, Jay Nixon, who had been urged by Barack Obama to restore peace. Veteran civil rights activist John Lewis had also suggested that troops under federal control should replace local police, although Obama did not go so far as to condemn the latter. The change of tactics saw a reduction in the police presence and the appointment of a new police chief on the ground, Ron Johnson.

Rena Perry, 33, who had been among the crowds, said: “It’s just so different. The other nights the police were over there and we was over here. It was a war. This new guy has changed the atmosphere.” 

People gathered at a large intersection in a carnival-like demonstration. However, Johnson refused to rule out the use of military-style equipment that had initially attracted such controversy. Obama has called for a report on the events in Ferguson from the attorney general, Eric Holder.

And state fairs do not automatically lead to the image of a humble public servant, just trying to do right by real Americans.

As stunty as Undercover Boss is, there is a real point to it, and something like that might be the best we can hope for.

Or if it’s just too much to ask for policies back in Washington to reflect the lived experience of most Americans on display during our national politicians’ five-week vacation, how about being on the ground when matters on a more urgent, personal level? How about going beyond beyond butter cows, steak fries or even parachute-in appearances such as Obama’s front porch tour? Will we ever see a president – or 2016 contender – march on today’s picket lines, take the food-stamp challenge, or join in the peaceful Ferguson demonstrations rather than opine about them?

Proving one’s middle-class bona fides – or using someone’s wealth as proof of distance from it – is so ingrained in the American political discourse it’s hard to even differentiate it as a specific tactic.

The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington for those discussions. Part of the decision appears aimed at countering criticism that Obama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises.

Yet those crises turned the first week of Obama’s vacation into a working holiday. He made {on-camera statements}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/aug/15/iraq-us-broke-isis-siege-mount-sinjar-obama-video""> on US military action in Iraq and the clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri. He called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and Hamas.

“I think it’s fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that’s why you’ve seen the president stay engaged,” the White House spokesman, Eric Schultz, said.

Obama is scheduled to return to Martha’s Vineyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend.

Even though work has occupied much of Obama’s first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to play golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island. He also attended a birthday party for Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan’s wife, where he spent time with former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

That get-together between the former rivals-turned-partners added another complicated dynamic to Obama’s vacation. Just as Obama was arriving on Martha’s Vineyard, an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which she levied some of her sharpest {criticism of Obama’s foreign policy.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/hillary-clinton-barack-obama-policy-syria-israel"">

Clinton later promised she and Obama would “hug it out” when they saw each other at Jordan’s party.

As the Pope endorsed the use of force to stop jihadists from the {Islamic State}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis""> (Isis) attacking religious minorities in northern Iraq, the shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, accused ministers of making confusing statements.

Alexander, who was speaking after the defence secretary, {Michael Fallon,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michael-fallon""> said Britain was no longer involved in ""simply a humanitarian mission"" in Iraq, told the BBC: ""I do think there is a case for clarity being brought to the respective statements of the foreign secretary and defence secretary.""

The prime minister sought to clarify Fallon's remarks by making clear there would be limits to Britain's involvement. Cameron told BBC1's Breakfast programme on Monday: ""Britain is not going to get involved in another war in {Iraq.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq""> We are not going to be putting boots on the ground. We are not going to be sending in the British army.""

The prime minister, who rejected calls for parliament to be recalled to discuss the Iraq crisis, insisted that there is a clear strategy to tackle the Isis extremists. He added: ""We should use all the assets we have – our diplomacy, our political relationships, our aid, the military prowess and expertise we have to help others – as part of a strategy to put pressure on Islamic State and make sure this terrorist organisation is properly addressed and it cannot cause mayhem on our own streets.""

But Alexander said: ""It would be important to understand the nature of the mission that British forces are now engaged in. Does that remain primarily focused on the humanitarian efforts? Because the humanitarian need continues to be huge.""

{Labour}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour""> believes ministers have been stumbling from one decision to another on Iraq. Downing Street announced last week that Tornado jets would be despatched to the region to monitor the needs of the Yazidi refugees besieged on Mount Sinjar. The Tornados are now conducting surveillance missions of Isis forces deep into Iraq.

Downing Street initially said it would only transport arms to Kurdish forces on behalf of other EU countries. But it then said it was prepared to supply British arms if requested. No 10 said that the British mission in Iraq was solely humanitarian. Fallon extended this over the weekend when he said that British warplanes are flying deep into Iraq to gather intelligence in a mission that could last ""months"".

The prime minister, who left the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, to chair a Cobra meeting as he delivered a speech on the family, resumed his holiday on Monday when he travelled to Cornwall after flying on government business to Exeter for a photo opportunity related to his speech.

A spokesman for Cameron said last night he had discussed the crisis with regional leaders in the Middle East including the Saudi and Jordanian kings and the emir of Qatar.

Cameron's decision to resume his holiday in Britain, after a week in Portugal, followed the decision of {Barack Obama to return to Washington from his holiday on Martha's Vineyard}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2014/08/17/obama-white-house-return-marthas-vineyard/14193419/""> to discuss the Iraq crisis and the disturbances in Ferguson, Missouri. The president is due to return to Martha's Vineyard on Tuesday.

Pope Francis said that he was considering with advisers whether to travel to Iraq to show solidarity with persecuted Christians. However, a decision has not yet been made, according to the Associated Press.

Asked by journalists on his flight back to the Vatican from South Korea whether he approved of the US air strikes against Isis, the Pope said: ""In these cases, where there is an unjust aggression, I can only say that it is licit to stop the unjust aggressor.

""I underscore the verb 'stop'. I'm not saying 'bomb' or 'make war', just 'stop'. And the means that can be used to stop them must be evaluated.""",NA,57,PM says army will not be sent into conflict as Labour accuses ministers of making confusing statements,NA

The president was right, of course. Summer holiday breaks provide an excellent opportunity to get off the treadmill and do just that while playing beach cricket with the kids.

But voters and their crowd-pleasing media don't like it. In today's puritan times, people who pay their way by the sweat of their brow or chained to a computer mouse are suspicious of merely cerebral activity as well as the sight of an elected public official enjoying him or herself in the sunshine. That applies even when August is a quiet month – as it so often hasn't been since the guns opened fire 100 summers ago. Whether chilled like Cameron or Blair, or tense like Thatcher or Gordon Brown, politicians just can't win.

So when a shirt-sleeved William Gladstone – ""the People's William"" – allowed himself to be photographed relaxing (he liked chopping down trees on his estate in north Wales), he signed a Faustian pact the paparazzi exploit to this day: the political holiday shot, granted in the hope of winning a few admiring votes and being left alone. US President Theodore Roosevelt (1901-9) thrived on hunting-and-fishing action shots. Vladimir Putin still does.

Gladstone the intellectual also liked staying at smart seaside resorts (no photo opportunities there) in France where Ed Miliband is this summer. Just back from Portugal – he went to the Canaries at Easter – Cameron is now off to a family break in north Cornwall again, scene of the Hooray Henry holidays of his teens around the Camel estuary. Nick Clegg is with the in-laws as usual in Spain. Theresa May has been in the Alps (surely a coincidence that Thatcher did the same?) while Yvette Cooper and Ed Balls bravely took their three kids on a week-long train journey to Greece via Venice and Vienna.

At least European leaders have their passports, though Berlusconi's, Sarkozy's and Chirac's weakness for exotic extravagance was no more popular than Tony Blair's search for palazzos in Tuscany and Freebie. Solid, sensible Angela Merkel prefers to walk in the mountains with her invisible hubbie. By contrast, US presidents daren't vacation abroad (""what's wrong with America?"") and are warned off elite locations for the rich. ""Can I fish if I don't catch anything?"" Bill Clinton once moaned, though hedonistic Clinton could enjoy himself in a padded cell.

Obama has an alibi. Like George W Bush working on his mini-ranch in Texas, he can and does holiday in distant Hawaii on the unarguable grounds that it is both home and US soil. It doesn't prevent media storms (""why is Michelle staying on?"") like the one which forced him to take a break from golf in rich Martha's Vinyard as Ferguson rioted over the police shooting of Michael Brown. As for New York's leftwing mayor, Bill de Blasio, he went home too, but to Italy where he savoured delicious three-hour lunches: very unAmerican. August is New York's media silly season too.

The real complaint against political summer holidays are that they are too long. Parliament now comes back for two pre-conference weeks in September. It has not stopped some MPs and newspapers (even the FT) demanding an early recall to debate options for the crisis in Iraq and or Ukraine rather than leaving it to novice ministers like Phil Hammond and Michael Fallon. It is true ""quiet August"" is not a policy that would obtain low-cost insurance. The 2007-2009 banking crisis first boiled up in August, as did Suez (1956), Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait (1990) and Russian troops entry into Prague (1968). The Berlin Wall went up in August (1961) while Hitler and Stalin did their deal in August 1939, which guaranteed the second world war. The Kaiser's troops marched west in August 1914.

As Cameron will vividly remember it was also in August (2013) that MPs recalled from the beach voted against military intervention in Syria; little wonder he is not keen to summon them now. But that decision reflects only the democratic legitimation side of the policymaker's ledger. In a wired age of (mostly) secure high-speed internet communications unimaginable even in Thatcher's day, the flow of information and options for near-instant communications with Whitehall or the White House make executive decision-making a practical reality.

It was not so when sterling's gold standard crisis of 1931 forced Tory leader, Stanley Baldwin, to break his usual month in the tranquil French Alps to return to London (twice), by train, not RAF helicopter. So when Cameron protests, as he did again this month, that ""wherever I am in the world I am always within a few feet of a Blackberry and able to manage things should they need to be managed,"" he spoke the truth.

Fellow Etonian and famously unflappable Harold Macmillan would have approved from his languid August grouse moor. But symbolism sometimes still dictates otherwise, requiring an aspiring statesman to show hands-on leadership by making a pointless journey for the TV cameras. Macmillan the showman would have understood that. So would Gladstone the axeman.",NA,19,"Whether chilling like David Cameron or tense like Gordon Brown, politicians can't win in August – a usually explosive month",NA

Here's a summary of where things stand:

• A day of fast-paced developments in Ferguson, Missouri, ended with attorneys for the 

family of Michael Brown, 18, calling for calm in the streets and praising the work of 

Governor Jay Nixon and President Barack Obama.

• The family had a harsher appraisal of the local police force, who this morning released 

the name of the officer who shot Brown dead on 9 August. He is Darren Wilson, a 6-year 

veteran.

• Simultaneous to the release of Wilson’s name, Ferguson police released an incident 

report naming Brown as a suspect in an alleged store robbery. The report included 

surveillance images of a man, apparently Brown, standing over a store clerk. Later police 

released {video}

incident.

• Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said Friday afternoon that officer Wilson 

stopped Brown because Brown was “blocking traffic” – and not in connection with the 

alleged robbery.

• The family said the release of the video and incident report was designed to distract 

attention from the police killing of Brown. “It was a character assassination,” a lawyer for 

the family said.

• Many protesters {expressed anger}

Johnson told MSNBC:

Brown in the back. At that point, Johnson says Brown stopped, turned with his hands up 

and said “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!”

fired several more shots. Johnson described watching Brown go from standing with his 

hands up to crumbling to the ground and curling into a fetal position.""

15 Aug 2014 16:47: A second lawyer, Anthony Gray, speaks. He says Brown had his 

hands in the air and was still shot.

He says Brown’s parents have acknowledged that their son had had discipline problems.

He says no matter what further pictures or anything else that may come out, the focus 

should be on the police killing of Brown.

“The family feels that that was strategic, they feel that it was aimed at denigrating their 

son, it was a character assassination,” Gray says.

""He’s now inciting the community all over again. If you get this kind of negative reaction 

to this... it won’t be on anybody’s part on this side. .. Now we’re focused on the side

15 Aug 2014 16:43: Brown lawayer: 'we totally trust' federal investigation

Daryl Parks, a lawyer for the Brown family, is speaking at a news conference.

“The video has nothing to do with how he was killed on that day,” Parks says, referring 

to the convenience store surveillance video.

The Feds are conducting a full investigation. They have talked to the mother, he says.

“On behalf of the family, we totally trust the investigation that they are doing,” he says.

“Lastly, we want to thank everyone. THe family particularly wants to thank Governor 

Nixon....We also want to thank President Obama.

""This family has belonged to this community for a long time.
They want nothing less than law and order tonight. ... As we remember Mike Brown.
We believe the most important thing, is what happened that particular day, in the middle 

of the street, is that officer killed Mike Brown. Let’s not lose sight of that.""

15 Aug 2014 16:05: Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson’s statement Friday afternoon 

that Officer Darren Wilson did not stop Michael Brown in connection with an alleged 

robbery minutes early seems clearly to contradict an account of the stop earlier Friday 

by... {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> police 

chief Thomas Jackson.

On Friday morning, chief Jackson said Wilson “left a sick call” after “dispatch gave a 

description of a robbery suspect over the radio.” The seemingly clear implication was 

that Wilson left the sick call expressly to seek the suspect in the alleged robbery.

This recording is from CNN’s broadcast of chief Jackson’s news conference Friday 

morning:

{Ferguson chief: 'description of a robbery suspect over the radio'}

<hyperlink=""https://soundcloud.com/tommccarthy-3/ferguson-chief-description-of-a-

Chief Jackson said:

""At 11.52, dispatch gave a description of a robbery suspect over the radio. A different 

officer arrived at the store where the strongarm robbery occurred.
A further description, more detailed, was given over the radio, and uh, stated the officer 

was walking toward – er the uh, suspect was walking toward QuikTrip. Our officer left the

15 Aug 2014 15:17: Ferguson chief: Wilson 'a gentle, quiet man'

Jackson is asked about Darren Wilson.

“He was a gentle, quiet man, he was a distinguished officer,” Jackson says. “He was a 

gentleman, a quiet officer. He is, has been” a good officer. 

“It’s devastating. He never intended for this to happen.”

15 Aug 2014 15:16: Jackson is asked: If the alleged robbery had nothing to do with 

Brown being stopped, then why would you release the video of the robbery?

“Because you asked for it,” Jackson says.

Jackson again refers to county police for any further information about the killing of 

Brown.

15 Aug 2014 15:15: Jackson says the officer who stopped Brown did not stop him in 

connection with the alleged robbery. Brown was stopped, Jackson says, “Because he was 

walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic. That was it.”

Jackson says officer Darren Wilson had served two years with Jennings police and four 

years with {Ferguson.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson"">

15 Aug 2014 15:12: Ferguson chief: 'We have given you everything we have'

Jackson is asked about the Brown family statement of outrage at the piecemeal release 

of information by the police.

“My response to that is my heart goes out to the family...

We have given you everything we have now, everything we can give you.""

15 Aug 2014 15:11: Jackson says he can’t release further information – the description 

of the Brown killing, he means – because it pertains to an ongoing investigation.

“There is a use of force report that we have,” Jackson says. He says all reports on this will 

be written by the county police.

As for the incident report in the Brown killing, “I don’t have it in my possession,” Jackson 

says. “Everything belongs to the county.

“What I did was release the video tape to you because I had to. I didn’t sit on it. Too 

many people put in FOI requests.”

15 Aug 2014 15:07: The {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-

pretty much given you every bit of information we have now,” he says.

He said the surveillance video was released because “We didn’t have good cause to not 

release it under FOI.”

“We decided at the same time it wouldn’t be prudent to release that information that 

could be a little bit, uh, I don’t know [...]
We’ve pretty much given you every bit of information we have now. I don’t think there’s 

anything else to give out.""

15 Aug 2014 15:05: Video: “They killed him for no reason”

A video has been uploaded to YouTube recorded by a bystander in the immediate 

aftermath of the Michael Brown killing. The ten-minute video shows Brown’s body lying 

in the street in a pool of blood. The area is cordoned off with police tape.

Additional police arrive at the scene as residents gather outside the tape. Residents yell 

at police, accusing them of murder and demanding an ambulance. “Ain’t no ambulance,” 

the video narrator says. “He’s gone.”

15 Aug 2014 14:52: The Senate intends to review the program under which the 

Pentagon transfers military gear and weapons to local police departments, Guardian US

""The head of the Senate Armed Services Committee says he intends to review the

Missouri and elsewhere.
Known as the 1033 program, the purpose of the transfers was to ensure police were able 

to withstand comparatively well-armed drug networks. Along with grant money provided 

by the Department of Homeland Security in the wake of 9/11, it has enabled police 

departments around the country to increasingly kit themselves like military units, even 

for routine policework.
“Congress established this program out of real concern that local law enforcement 

agencies were literally outgunned by drug criminals. We intended this equipment to 

keep police officers and their communities safe from heavily armed drug gangs and 

terrorist incidents. Before the defense authorization bill comes to the Senate floor, we 

will review this program to determine if equipment provided by the Defense Department 

is being used as intended,” Sen. Carl Levin, a retiring Michigan Democrat, said on Friday.""

""On Thursday, Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, defended the surplus 

transfers.
“This is a useful program that allows for the re-use of military equipment that otherwise 

would be disposed of that can be used again by law enforcement agencies to serve their 

citizens. The program serves a purpose,” Kirby said.
“That said, it is up to law enforcement agencies to speak to how and what they gain 

through this system, and I’m not going to inject the Pentagon into this discussion. How 

this equipment is used to serve local citizens is up for local law enforcement agencies to 

speak to.”""

[tweetbegin 500334583075069952 tweetend]

The statement reads:

“Michael Brown’s family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has 

chosen to disseminate piecemeal information in a manner intended to assassinate the 

character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad 

daylight.
There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the 

execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which 

is the universal sign of surrender.
The prolonged release of the officer’s name and then the subsequent alleged 

information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community 

have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.
It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and 

refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.
The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from 

being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that 

caused Michael’s death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an 

unarmed teenager.”

15 Aug 2014 13:03: As our live blog coverage continues, here’s a summary of where things stand:

• Ferguson police declined to describe how and why Michael Brown, 18, was killed on 9 August, but they did {name the officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/15/ferguson-police-officer-michael-brown-darren-wilson#block-53ee23d0e4b06c461acbb585""> who shot him, Darren Wilson, a six-year veteran of the force.

• A lawyer for the Brown family {accused police}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/15/ferguson-police-officer-michael-brown-darren-wilson#block-53ee3821e4b06c461acbb5a6""> of “character assassination” against Brown.

“We see that there’s tape, that they claim they got a tape that shows there was some sort of strong-armed robbery,” said Freeman Bosley, Johnson’s attorney. “We need to see that tape, my client did tell us and told the FBI that they went into the store.

""The attorney, Benjamin Crump, says Brown’s parents are “incensed” by what he calls “the old game of smoke and mirrors.” He says the family was blind-sided by Friday’s announcement.
Crump says “it’s bad enough they assassinated him, and now they’re trying to assassinate his character.”""

15 Aug 2014 12:40: Nixon pushes back at criticism – {voiced Thursday night}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/15/ferguson-police-officer-michael-brown-darren-wilson#block-53ee2dbde4b0f5010eedd8f7""> by county attorney Bob McCulloch – of his decision to switch out county police for state patrol on the Ferguson front lines: 

""I think we’re learning a lot, but I don’t want to be critical of anybody.... I made the decision that I made, to shift... and I think it made a big positive difference over the last 18 hours.""

Nixon says the two investigations, federal and county, are proceeding in parallel:

""I think there are going to be some bumps along the road to justice. I think there are going to be some moments of angst.""

Nixon answers criticism that he was missing in action in the first days of the crisis. He says he asked for a federal investigation Monday and that he has “appeared in the community” every day thereafter.” It was not until late Wednesday, however, that Nixon announced he had canceled plans to attend the state fair Thursday in favor of appearing in {Ferguson.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson"">

15 Aug 2014 12:33: Nixon returns to talk of “energy,” a concept that figured prominently, if somewhat cryptically, in his statements Thursday. He says there’s a “great deal” of “appropriate, active real energy” in the community, and the community also needs “focused energy.”

15 Aug 2014 12:30: Nixon: 'Nothing should deter' Brown probe

Governor Nixon takes the lectern again. He praises an “outstanding job” by Captain Johnson.

“Nothing should deter figuring out how and why Michael Brown was killed,” Nixon says. “But there’s a lot of steps between now and when justice is served. And there will be a lot of other bounces along the way. And there will be a lot of tension at times.”

15 Aug 2014 12:22: Johnson on racial tensions in Missouri:

""I agree that this is not a black-and-white issue. Because we all have sons and daughters... The governor talked about old wounds, and this is an old wound. It’s time to stop saying this is an old wound and close it for good.""

15 Aug 2014 12:20: Johnson takes a question, inaudible in broadcasts, from a resident who apparently expresses anger with the {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> police.

Johnson replies:

""In our anger, we have to make sure that we don’t burn down our own house. Vandalize buildings... that does not prove a point. That does not solve issues. That hurts this community.""

15 Aug 2014 12:18: Johnson says he’ll keep talking to people – but can’t address the alleged store robbery or how Brown was killed.

""You saw me out there talking. Communicating. Understanding with respect. And that's our mission.
I can't speak about the incident there. I wasn't there.""

As for what to expect for tonight: A “bunch of hugs,” Johnson says:

""You’re going to see a bunch of smiles, a bunch of hugs, a bunch of conversations – so that’s what you’re going to see from me.""

15 Aug 2014 12:15: Johnson is asked whether the picture of the suspect in the convenience store video is necessarily Mike Brown.

“I have not seen that,” says Johnson. “But I guarantee you I will look at that. And that’s why I’m down here, so I can get that kind of information.”

“What happened last night is what’s going to happen from here forward.”

Johnson says there’s no animosity between state and county officers. “No there’s not,” he says.

15 Aug 2014 12:13: Johnson says he hasn’t seen surveillance video of the alleged convenience store robbery.

He says he’s going to meet with {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> chief Jackson and talk about “how it was released” -- referring to the incident report and, presumably, the lack of a report about Brown’s killing.

“Some of the [details] that were unclear,” Johnson says, “I will try to make those clear.”

15 Aug 2014 12:12: Johnson: 'Last night was a great night'

“Last night was a great night,” Johnson says. “There was no calls for service.”:

No tear gas, no road blocks, no arrests, he says. “We were communicating a lot better... we had many leaders and activists out there... and that’s what I expect to continue throughout this event.

He says he was joined in the crowd by county police chief Jon Belmar, the man he replaced in command.

Johnson says he was back in the street Friday morning and would be tonight.

15 Aug 2014 12:10: Replogle says “the best resource that I could bring to this situation was Captain Ron Johnson.

Johnson takes the lectern and is applauded. “If you can’t hear me I’ll step out into the crowd a little bit,” he says. “I’m here to make sure they hear what I’m talking about.”

He steps away from the lectern, to the protest of media members, who now have a hard time hearing him.

Johnson wants to talk to the crowd, not the media.

15 Aug 2014 12:09: Governor Jay Nixon is speaking. He turns quickly to highway patrol colonel Ronald Replogle, who describes the decision to put Captain Ron Johnson in charge of security.

Technical difficulties – audio went out. 

15 Aug 2014 12:03: St Louis mayor Francis Slay said he thought criticism by county attorney Bob McCulloch of Governor Jay Nixon’s decision to remove county police from the front lines in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> was “ill-timed and wrong.”

McCulloch, who is in charge of the county investigation into Michael Brown’s killing (there is a separate federal investigation), had sharp words Thursday night for the governor’s decision – a decision that turned out to restore peace to Ferguson streets.

“It’s shameful what he did today, he had no legal authority to do that,” McCulloch {said}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/gov-nixon-gives-police-control-of-ferguson-situation-to-missouri/article_0806541b-ed48-5d06-9267-323531ad6cf1.html""> Thursday evening. “To denigrate the men and women of the county police department is shameful.”
“For Nixon to never talk to the commanders in the field and come in here and take this action is disgraceful,” McCulloch said.
“I hope I’m wrong, but I think what Nixon did may put a lot of people in danger.”

On Friday, Mayor Slay said McCulloch was “wrong”:

The suspect reportedly stole a box of cigars. [redacted] arrived on scene prior to I and obtained the following information. [redacted] advised that the suspect, was wearing a white t-shirt, khaki shorts, yellow socks and wearing a red hat. The suspect was last seen going North on W. Florissant towards Quik Trip. I arrived to the area and began to canvass. I canvassed northbound on W. Florissand Rd. from Ferguson Ave. I observed no subjects, matching the description, on W. Florissant from {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> Ave. to Northwinds Estates Dr. I also canvassed Northwinds Estates Dr. and did not locate the suspect. [redacted] was canvassing the area as well and canvassed Quik Trip.""

The same document includes a note from Sunday, 10 August, saying “I contacted [redacted] and received a copy of their surveillance video on disc of the incident. I was unable to view the disc as our computer system would not read it. The disc was entered into evidence.”

15 Aug 2014 10:38: The man named as a second suspect in the alleged convenience store robbery, Dorian Johnson, has given his account of how Michael Brown was killed. The police have not released their account.

Johnson {spoke with}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> MSNBC’s Trymaine Lee: 

""The police say the officer shot Brown after the teen shoved the officer and tried to wrestle the officer’s gun from him. But a number of witnesses, including Johnson, refute those claims.""

Johnson’s {account}<hyperlink=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/eyewitness-michael-brown-fatal-shooting-missouri""> does not mention a robbery.

""About 20 minutes before the shooting, Johnson said he saw Brown walking down the street and decided to catch up with him. The two walked and talked. That’s when Johnson says they saw the police car rolling up to them.
The officer demanded that the two “get the f—k on the sidewalk,” Johnson says. “His exact words were get the f—k on the sidewalk.”
After telling the officer that they were almost at their destination, Johnson’s house, the two continued walking. But as they did, Johnson says the officer slammed his brakes and threw his truck in reverse, nearly hitting them. [...]
“They’re not wrestling so much as his arm went from his throat to now clenched on his shirt,” Johnson explained of the scene between Brown and the officer. “It’s like tug of war. He’s trying to pull him in. He’s pulling away, that’s when I heard, ‘I’m gonna shoot you.’” [...]""

A second later Johnson said he heard the first shot go off, Lee reports:

""“The whole time [the officer] was holding my friend until the gun went off,” Johnson noted.
Brown and Johnson took off running together. There were three cars lined up along the side of the street. Johnson says he ducked behind the first car, whose two passengers were screaming. Crouching down a bit, he watched Brown run past.
“Keep running, bro!,” he said Brown yelled. Then Brown yelled it a second time. Those would be the last words Johnson’s friend, “Big Mike,” would ever say to him.
Brown made it past the third car. Then, “blam!” the officer took his second shot, striking Brown in the back. At that point, Johnson says Brown stopped, turned with his hands up and said “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!”""

15 Aug 2014 10:22: Here’s a note in the {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> PD incident report on the alleged convenience store robbery tying the robbery to Brown’s killing:

""It is worth mentioning that this incident is related to another incident detailed under Ferguson Police Report # 2014-12391 as well as St Louis County Police Report # 2014-43984. In that incident, Brown was fatally wounded involving an officer of this department. I responded to that scene and observed Brown. After viewing Brown and reviewing this video, I was able to confirm that Brown is the primary suspect in this incident. A second person, also at that scene, identified himself as being with Brown. That person was later identified as Dorian Johnson. After observing Johnson and reviewing the video, I confirmed he is the second suspect in this incident.""

More to come as we get it.

15 Aug 2014 10:14: Ferguson incident report

Here is a portion of the {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> Police Department incident report from 9 August 2014, describing a felony “robbery – second strongarm–convenience store”

""Had just come out of the restroom and returned to the counter where she observed Brown tell [redacted] that he (Brown) wanted several boxes of cigars. As [redacted] was placing the boxes on the counter, Brown grabbed a box of Swisher Sweet cigars and handed them to Johnson who was standing behind Brown. [redacted] witnessed [redacted] tell Brown that he had to pay for those cigars first. That is when Brown reached across the counter and grabbed numerous packs of Swisher Sweets and turned to the [sic] leave the store. [redacted] calls “911”. Meanwhile, [redacted] comes out from behind the counter and attempts to stop Brown from leaving. According to [redacted], [redacted] was trying to lock the door until Brown returned the merchandise to him. That is when Brown grabbed [redacted] by the shirt and forcefully pushed him back in to a display rack. [redacted] backed away and Brown and Johnson exited the store with the cigars.
I then had the opportunity to review a copy of the video surveillance footage which captured the following events. The date and time stamps correspond to the video footage provided. The entire incident takes place on Saturday, 08/09/2014 between 11.52.58hrs and 11.54.00hrs.
[report lists cameras at convenience store that caught what it goes on to describe as follows]:
The video reveals Brown enter the store followed by Johnson. Brown approaches the register with Johnson standing behind him. [redacted] can be seen in the background walking from the restroom to behind the counter. Brown hands a box of Swisher Sweets to Johnson. An apparent struggle or confrontation seems to take place with Brown, however it is obscured by a display case on the counter. Meanwhile, Johnson sets the box he was handed back on the counter. Brown turns away from the counter with another box of Swisher Sweet cigars and walks towards the exit door.
[redacted] then comes out from behind the counter, with what appears to be a set of keys in his hands.
[redacted] then stands between Brown and the exit door. Brown, still holding a box [sic] Swisher Sweets in his right hand, grabs [redacted] by his shirt with this left hand. Brown aggressively pulls [redacted] in close to him and then immediately pushes him back in to a display rack. Johnson continues out the door and out of camera frame. [redacted], no longer between Brown and the door, stops and watches Brown as he walks towards the exit door. Brown then abruptly turns back around and advances on [redacted] Brown towers over [redacted] appearing to intimidate him. Brown then turns back around and walks out of camera view.""

At the end of the report is a note noting that the robbery report relates to a separate incident report describing the events around Brown’s killing. We’ll post the note shortly.

15 Aug 2014 10:11: Police in {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> on Friday released the name of the officer who shot an unarmed 18-year-old, Michael Brown, on 9 August. He is Darren Wilson, a six-year member of the police force.

The shooting prompted days of protests in {Ferguson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> Missouri.
Jackson also released part of an incident report implicating Brown in the robbery of a convenience store directly before the fatal encounter. Jackson said Wilson was responding to the robbery call when he confronted Brown.

Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post tweeted pictures from a security camera in the store, purporting to depict the robbery. The stills show an assailant that appears to be Brown confronting another man in the store.

Guardian,guard71,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/mike-brown-ferguson-shooting-police-black,The ghost of Mike Brown: why must a dead black child defend his right to life?,Steven W Thrasher,08/12/14,04/27/16,"Mike Brown is currently engaged in one of the most difficult, but common – for black men, anyway – forms of criminal defense in the American criminal justice system: he is engaged in The Ultimate Defense.

Granted, it’s rather hard for him to wield The Ultimate Defense effectively, as the unarmed teenager was killed over the weekend – shot dead by a police officer in Ferguson, {Missouri.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> But that’s the cruel irony of The Ultimate Defense: it’s always invoked posthumously, when the defendant can’t really defend himself because …well, because he’s dead.

Why was he in the police car?, people will ask. Why did he run? If he’d just been a pliant enough, wouldn’t he still be alive?!

Brown’s prosecutors in the court of public opinion will nonetheless demand he defend himself against these charges because he was a black teenager. His killer will remain presumed innocent. But for Mike Brown, there was a collective presumption of his guilt by the Ferguson police ... and that of the Ferguson citizens who gathered to air their grievances about the shooting long before any rioting started – and the timing of this is important. As a St Louis community activist who talked to me on Monday put it, he knew something was amiss when the police stationed K-9 units at the protest at 9am protest on Sunday.

“I have never seen police dogs barking at us at a peaceful march before,” he said.

The dogs aren’t just present in historic images of Southern police intimidating civil rights protests. (St Louis, notably, is the largest city in Missouri which, via the eponymous Missouri Compromise, was the last slave state admitted to the union.) The dogs are also tied into how other burned-out northern industrial towns use harsh police tactics – like {the tear gas and rubber bullets fired at protestors on Monday night}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/michael-brown-shooting-ferguson-missouri-police-crack-down-protesters""> – to keep their marginalized peoples from erupting, and how northern and southern tension merge in St Louis, smack in the middle of the US.

[tweetbegin 499025925691170816 tweetend]

But such containment can’t last forever. I spent some time in St. Louis earlier this year reporting on {a racially-charged story}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/steventhrasher/how-college-wrestling-star-tiger-mandingo-became-an-hiv-scap""> and came away extremely depressed by how blighted huge swaths of the metro area are. Ferguson sits north of the city, not so far from where Pruitt-Igoe –the {most notoriously disastrous housing project built during Urban Renewal}<hyperlink=""http://www.riverfronttimes.com/movies/the-pruitt-igoe-myth-an-urban-history-1251078/""> – once stood. It was abandoned and blown up less than 20 years after it broke ground. What remains nearby the now overgrown ruin, like what’s visible throughout much of metropolitan St Louis where black people live, is an “economy” based on fast-food restaurants, payday loan sharks, casinos and, inevitably, crime.

In such quarters of our nation, where men seem as likely to have contact with the criminal justice system as with the public education system, citizens often find themselves on the defensive with police.

The Ultimate Defense is the final step in how black men (or, in the cases of {Trayvon Martin,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin""> Jordan Davis, Mike Brown and many more, black children) try to navigate this uneasy relationship with law enforcement in the United States, which collectively assumes our guilt before, during and after alleged crimes occur. This presumption doesn’t die – even when one of us is killed by law enforcement.

The first step in navigating this assumed guilt is “the talk”. My father, who was {routinely harassed by police}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/steventhrasher/a-personal-and-political-history-of-the-afro""> when he was driving to college at night, had “the talk” with me when I was six or seven, explaining how people would automatically assume that I was up to no good, and would often even presume I was about to commit (or had just committed) a crime.

I’d never heard white people discuss “the talk” until George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin, when some conservatives started having strong ideas about {how “the talk” could be altered for the benefit of white people.}<hyperlink=""http://takimag.com/article/the_talk_nonblack_version_john_derbyshire/print#axzz3A7M8Mddk""> But I’ve heard endless variations of “the talk” among black folks – perhaps the most alarmingly when I was investigating police profiling in New York City in 2011. That’s when I learned the term “stop and frisk virginity”: black and Latino boys, as young as 10, would brag about who’d lost theirs or who was still a virgin.

Having a police officer act out his presumption of your guilt, it seems, is so ubiquitous – even today – that it’s a rite of passage toward manhood for these black and brown boys.

Their understanding is rooted in a harsh reality. In New York City, where I live and where Eric Garner was recently {choked to death during an arrest,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide""> people of color are thought to be more guilty of crimes and therefore {more likely to be stopped.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/summons-broken-windows-racial-disparity-garner-article-1.1890567""> And while black and brown New Yorkers are {stopped exponentially more often,}<hyperlink=""http://www.villagevoice.com/2011-09-21/news/young-mens-initiative-bloomberg-white-mayor-s-burden/full/""> the NYPD’s own data “demonstrate slightly higher rates of contraband yield” from white people than Hispanics or blacks. 

In Ferguson, as in New York, {black citizens are also far more likely to be stopped by cops,}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/blacks-overwhelmingly-get-stopped-by-the-police-in-ferguson""> even though the Attorney General’s office reports that “whites are actually more likely to have contraband”.

It takes micro-defenses, if you will, to manage these daily assumptions of guilt, whether you’re {a teen stopped on the street,}<hyperlink=""http://www.thenation.com/article/170413/stopped-and-frisked-being-fking-mutt-video""> a {shopper followed in a store,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/barneys-racial-profiling-settlement""> or a {Harvard professor arrested for entering your own house.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/21/henry-louis-gates-jr-arrest-harvard""> But a lack of habeas corpus is easier to fight with breath in your corpus. Lacking that, you need The Ultimate Defense.

Why were you wearing a hoodie? And walking through a gated community while black? Those are the kinds of questions Trayvon Martin had to ultimately defend himself against posthumously, despite the fact the unarmed 17 year-old was killed by a gun wielding maniac (who’d eventually walk away free and {later harm women}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/george-zimmerman-possession-five-guns-arrest"">). Trayvon must have done something to deserve his death.

Why were you playing your music so loud? Don’t you know you’d still be alive if you had your music quieter? Ultimately, Jordan Davis had to defend himself for that. One jury {couldn’t decide}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/19/florida-juror-loud-music-killer-michael-dunn""> if Davis’s right to life trumped Michael Dunn’s right to “stand his ground” at a gas station. Jordan must have done something to deserve his death.

And now, Mike Brown’s ghost has to similarly invoke The Ultimate Defense. Sadly, the weight of all of this is being born by Mike Brown’s family, who have to simultaneously proffer The Ultimate Defense to a skeptical public: that their son, alive last week, had the right to live to see this one.",216,3546,"The assumption that black people must be guilty of something lies behind the Ferguson shooting, and the police reaction",NA

Guardian,guard77,http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/11/21-things-you-need-to-know-about-buzzfeeds-success,21 things you need to know about BuzzFeed's success,Elena Cresci,08/11/14,04/27/16,"1. It’s not just about lists
In the words of BuzzFeed’s editorial director Jack Shepherd: {“A list is just scaffolding for a story”}<hyperlink=""http://www.newsrewired.com/2014/02/20/live-keynote-speech-from-jack-shepherd/""> – but BuzzFeed definitely isn’t just a load of lists. It also does news, long-form features and videos.

2. And it’s not just cats and gifs either ... but there are a lot of them on there
Because cats and gifs are great. *prepares to staunchly defend them in the comments*

3. BuzzFeed loves sloths a lot too

4. And corgis
[tweetbegin 439120010272067584 tweetend]

5. On a serious note: it’s set the tone for digital media
No, BuzzFeed didn’t invent the “listicle” and it didn’t invent quizzes. But since it launched in 2006, {BuzzFeed}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/buzzfeed""> has changed the digital landscape considerably.
From regional to national and international media, everyone’s trying to imitate it for one simple reason – what BuzzFeed does really does work. For example, i100 (the Independent’s viral news site) has an article called {The 12 ways in which Ukip is the gift that keeps on giving,}<hyperlink=""http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/the-12-ways-in-which-ukip-is-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving--l19bKyNYA""> WalesOnline has a list of {18 things you only remember if you went to university in Swansea in the 1990s}<hyperlink=""http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/fun-stuff/swansea-university-things-you-would-7544963""> ... even the Guardian has been known to publish the odd list every now and then.

6. It’s not about views, it’s about shares
[tweetbegin 436472506690457602 tweetend]

A whopping {75% of BuzzFeed’s traffic}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedrum.com/news/2014/07/29/humour-nostalgia-and-value-buzzfeed-shares-its-branded-content-lessons""> comes from social media.

7. So they know exactly how to target social networks
How do you get Twitter to pay attention to you? You write about Twitter, of course. “{The 29 stages of a Twitterstorm}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/tomphillips/the-29-stages-of-a-twitterstorm"">” is a classic example.

8. ... especially Pinterest
As far as social traffic is concerned, Facebook is where it’s at. But BuzzFeed’s {second biggest source of social traffic comes from Pinterest,}<hyperlink=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2014/07/17/nailed-it-buzzfeed-cracks-the-pinterest-code/""> a social network linked more with life and style content rather than news.

9. They’re pretty good at video too
{BuzzFeedVideo}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/user/BuzzFeedVideo""> has more than 2m subscribers on YouTube.

10. And they know exactly how to get you to share their stuff
The reason those quizzes are so popular: “Oh I SO AM Hodor from Game of Thrones and I want all of my Facebook friends to know!”

{BuzzFeed UK’s editor Luke Lewis told The Drum}<hyperlink=""http://www.thedrum.com/news/2014/03/25/there-s-hunger-political-content-s-fun-and-entertaining-luke-lewis-editor-buzzfeed"">: “We appeal to human beings, not GoogleBots.” Part of the reason you’ll see extremely niche content ({26 things only emo kids will understand}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/jobarrow/only-emo-kids-understand"">) is because people are far more likely to share if they identify strongly with it.

11. It all started with an email chain
This article from New York magazine explains {how the seeds of BuzzFeed were sown with one email thread}<hyperlink=""http://nymag.com/news/features/buzzfeed-2013-4/"">:
In 2001, [founder Jonah] Peretti, then 27, was supposed to be writing his master’s thesis but instead diverted himself by goofing off online. Nike was promoting a new customizable sneaker; Peretti ordered a pair imprinted with the wordsweatshop, prompting an amusing exchange of e-mails with a customer-­service representative. Peretti forwarded the chain to ten friends. It went forth and multiplied, {taking on irresistible}<hyperlink=""http://www.shey.net/niked.html""> momentum as it was forwarded from in-box to in-box. Six weeks later, Peretti found himself on theToday show, debating a Nike spokesman about its labor practices.

12. And it grew from there
Peretti wanted to prove he could repeat the same kind of virality, and he’s succeeded. Nowadays, BuzzFeed boasts a monthly audience of more than 150 million and counting.

13. They’ve expanded pretty quickly
BuzzFeed now has offices all over the world, including London, Mumbai, Sydney and Paris.

14. BuzzFeedUK was born after Lewis {approached them with a mockup of what a British version of the site}<hyperlink=""http://www.gorkana.com/news/consumer/little-black-book/gorkana-meetsbuzzfeed/""> could look like
We’re not sure if the mock up was anything like this though:
[tweetbegin 316101992592314368 tweetend]

15. They’ve had kudos and investment from some of the biggest names in the business ... including Rupert Murdoch
[tweetbegin 433704142683389952 tweetend]

16. They’re pretty serious about news – whether it’s breaking news ... 
[tweetbegin 498700186328502272 tweetend]

17. ... or investigative journalism
BuzzFeed has made a number of really clever hires in the last year to this end, including {Pulitzer prizewinner Mark Schoofs}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/business/media/buzzfeed-hires-pulitzer-winner-to-head-investigative-unit.html""> to head up their investigative unit.

18. BuzzFeed is just going to get bigger and bigger with a little help from its {$50m (£30m) of new funding}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/11/buzzfeed-funding-media-andreessen-horowitz"">
The new funding comes from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which has backed the likes of Twitter and AirBnB.

19. It’s not without its controversy
Last month, BuzzFeed sacked its viral politics editor Benny Johnson after finding he had copied sentences and phrases {“word for word”}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/26/buzzfeed-sacks-editor-benny-johnson-plagiarism""> from other sites.

20. But they are very good at what they do
BuzzFeed has gone from a small viral lab based in New York to a huge global media and technology company – and it’s not even 10 years old yet.

21. Also: BuzzFeedUK has an office dog

Follow the Guardian’s Rory Carroll ({@rorycarroll72}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/rorycarroll72"">) and Jon Swaine ({@jonswaine}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jonswaine"">) for ongoing reporting from Ferguson.

Here’s a summary of where things stand:

• St Louis County police have created an {“organized protest zone”}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-national-guard-protests-updates#block-53f275a2e4b01af8c1288cd2""> as people gather for another night of demonstrations.

• {US president Barack Obama loosely addressed racial disparities}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-national-guard-protests-updates#block-53f26700e4b092330fee9fdd""> in the US criminal justice system while making remarks about Ferguson on Monday. “You have young men of color in many communities who are more likely to end up in jail or the criminal justice system, then they are in a good job or college,” Obama said.

• {He also said multiple times}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-national-guard-protests-updates#block-53f26617e4b01af8c1288cce""> that one of the great things about the US is how it distinguishes its military from local law enforcement. He said it may be worth it to review the {government’s controversial grant program}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-military-restraints-violence-weaponry-missouri""> that allows local law enforcement agencies to use excess military equipment.

• {Attorney general Eric Holder is heading to Ferguson on Wednesday,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/obama-attorney-general-eric-holder-ferguson""> said Obama. He will be there to meet with department of justice and FBI investigators who are already working in Ferguson. The two met earlier on Monday during a break from his vacation in Martha’s Vineyard. “I realize there is tremendous interest in the facts of the incident that led to Michael Brown’s death, but I ask for the public’s patience as we conduct this investigation,” {Holder said in a statement released after their meeting.}<hyperlink=""http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-ag-873.html"">

• State governor Jay Nixon {abandoned the curfew for Monday night.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-national-guard-protests-updates#block-53f23c99e4b092330fee9fbe""> Despite a curfew being in place on Sunday night from 12am to 5pm, it was largely considered the {most intense night of action thus far.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-michael-brown-national-guard-deployed"">

• Missouri’s national guard arrived in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> on Monday after governor Nixon called for their deployment in the early hours of the morning. He said they would be working alongside law enforcement who have been monitoring the unrest for the past eight days.

• {A Pew study released on Monday}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-national-guard-protests-updates#block-53f25456e4b01af8c1288cbf""> shows that black and white adults in the US have “sharply different reactions” to the shooting of Michael Brown. Of the 1,000 adults surveyed, 80% of black people said the story raises important issues about race, while 37% of white people felt that way.

18 Aug 2014 18:13: Reporter Chris Campbell spoke with a friend of Barbara Spradling, the girlfriend of the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, officer Darren Wilson. The friend {said that Wilson admits he shot Brown in the head.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-darren-wilson-account-michael-brown-shooting"">

“However, Wilson’s version of events, as told through Spradling to the friend, contradicts aspects of the accounts given by some other eyewitnesses, including Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown who was with him when he was stopped, minutes after the pair were allegedly involved in a robbery at a convenience store.
There appears to be little dispute that a struggle took place, though the pathologists who carried out the autopsy for Brown’s family said Monday their preliminary finding was that Brown’s body showed no evidence of one. The account provided by police, given in the hours after the shooting, is that Wilson stopped Brown and Johnson for walking down the middle of the street when they should have been on the sidewalk.
Spradling told the friend who spoke to the Guardian that Brown initiated the altercation by striking Wilson in the face, leading to a struggle for Wilson’s gun that resulted in one shot being fired in the police vehicle.”

18 Aug 2014 18:04: Several protesters were removed from demonstrations outside the Wainwright state office building in St Louis, according to {multiple}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/davidhunn/status/501487827168002048""> {reports.}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/Collin_MOTimes/status/501488187932684288""> A crowd gathered there earlier this afternoon.

18 Aug 2014 17:55: Police create ""organized protest zone""

St Louis County police department has created “an organized protest zone” for demonstrators to contain themselves in after eight nights of protests across the city’s streets. A media staging area will be across from the protest zone as law enforcement attempt to control the situation. The police department explained the zones in a statement:

An organized protest zone is being established at {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> and W. Florissant. Media can stay at existing media staging area, or move to new media staging area which will be across the street from the protest zone. This will put the media on the shoulder of the road, across the street on W. Florissant from the protest zone. Please be patient with us as we make this transition.
Also, W. Florissant will be closed to through traffic within the hour. As always, advise road blocks by showing media credentials for access.

18 Aug 2014 17:47: US attorney general Eric Holder released a statement on Monday following his meeting with Barack Obama about Ferguson and {provided details on the department of justice’s investigation}<hyperlink=""http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-ag-873.html""> into the shooting.

“I realize there is tremendous interest in the facts of the incident that led to Michael Brown’s death, but I ask for the public’s patience as we conduct this investigation,” Holder said. “The selective release of sensitive information that we have seen in this case so far is troubling to me. No matter how others pursue their own separate inquiries, the Justice Department is resolved to preserve the integrity of its investigation. This is a critical step in restoring trust between law enforcement and the community, not just in {Ferguson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> but beyond.”

Holder said an additional medical examination of Brown’s body is being performed today by “one of the most experienced medical examiners in the United States military.”

More than 40 FBI agents are canvassing the neighborhood where Michael Brown was shot and several interviews have been conducted.

“In order to truly begin the process of healing, we must also see an end to the acts of violence in the streets of Ferguson,” Holder said. “Those who have been peacefully demonstrating should join with law enforcement in condemning the actions of looters and others seeking to enflame tensions.

18 Aug 2014 17:33: Video of Barack Obama’s afternoon press conference on the situation in Ferguson. Obama called on protesters to be peaceful and said attorney general Eric Holder will be in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> on Wednesday.

And those two things – the violence of the state and the violence of the street – are connected. “A riot,” said Martin Luther King, “is the language of the unheard.” The people on the streets don’t donate thousands of dollars to anyone’s campaign. They don’t get a seat at any table where decisions are made or have the ear of the powerful. But with four black men killed by the police in the country in the last four weeks, they have a lot to say, and precious few avenues through which to say it. The question now is who’s listening.

18 Aug 2014 17:16: Some observers were critical of Obama’s remarks, which went in circles at times as he tried to avoid showing any bias in the Michael Brown case.

18 Aug 2014 16:56: Obama addresses racial disparities in US criminal justice system

“In too many communities around this country young men of color are left behind and seen as objects of fear,” Obama said. He repeatedly touted his My Brother’s Keeper initiative, which was created to address the opportunity gap men of color face in the US.

“You have young men of color in many communities who are more likely to end up in jail or the criminal justice system, then they are in a good job or college,” Obama said.

“We’ve made extraordinary progress, but it’s not enough,” he said.

“Part of this is looking at our criminal justice to make sure it is upholding the principle that everyone is equal before the law,” Obama said.

“Given the history of this country, where we can build up by making more confidence, more trust, making sure that our criminal justice system is acutely aware of the possibilities of disparities in treatment.”

18 Aug 2014 16:46: “In too many communities in this country, a gulf exists between the community and law enforcement,” Obama said.

“I think one of the great things about the United States is the ability to maintain a distinction between our military and domestic law enforcement,” Obama said. “That helps protect our civil liberties.”

A reporter asked Obama about the government’s grant program that allows local law enforcement agencies to use excess military equipment. Images of armored vehicles rolling down the streets of Ferguson, which has a population of about 21,000 people, {have renewed criticism for this program.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-military-restraints-violence-weaponry-missouri"">

“I think it’s probably useful for us to review how the funding has gone,” Obama said. “How local law enforcement has used local grant dollars to make sure they are purchasing stuff they actually need. There is a difference between the military and local law enforcement and we don’t want those lines blurred.”

18 Aug 2014 16:36: Attorney general Eric Holder to visit Ferguson on Wednesday

President {Barack Obama}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama""> is providing updates on the situation in Ferguson from the White House briefing room as he takes a brief break from his vacation. He met with attorney general Eric Holder earlier today to get updates on the situation.

He said he also spoke with governor Jay Nixon and other local politicians earlier today.

The justice department has opened an independent civil rights investigation into the shooting. Holder is traveling to {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> on Wednesday to meet with FBI and department of justice employees currently on the ground working on the investigation.

“We have all seen images of protestors and law enforcements in the streets, it’s clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting,” Obama said. “What is also clear is that a small minority are not.”

18 Aug 2014 16:13: The national guard is first and foremost a state agency which is why Missouri governor Jay Nixon was reportedly able to activate the troops {without running it by the White House.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-national-guard-protests-updates#block-53f22840e4b0f23fdd935186""> The Guardian’s {Lauren Gambino}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/LGamGam""> has more on what the national guard is and when it gets called up:

In 1992 California national guard forces were called in to regain control of Los Angeles after riots erupted when four white officers were acquitted of severely beating a black man, Rodney King. President George HW Bush then declared it a federal disaster area and called the guard into federal service. More than 50 people died and nearly 2,000 people were injured before the troops eventually quelled the situation.
Jim Craig, an associate professor of military and veteran studies at the University of Missouri-St Louis, questioned whether the presence of the national guard would be effective in {Ferguson.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> “The National Guard by design is militarised, and so that doesn’t theoretically de-escalate the situation. It actually may change the dynamic.”

18 Aug 2014 16:02: Missouri highway patrolman Ron Johnson said that law enforcement has a plan to maintain resident safety tonight. “We will also ensure that peaceful protests will be allowed in the city of {Ferguson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson"">” Johnson said.

“We will not allow vandals, criminal elements to impact the safety and security of this community,” Johnson said.

{Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> National Guard general Greg Mason said that his soldiers are well-trained, well-seasoned and well-resourced.

18 Aug 2014 15:40: A Pew study released on Monday shows that black and white adults in the US have “{sharply different reactions}<hyperlink=""http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/"">” to the shooting of Michael Brown. Of the 1,000 adults surveyed:

• 80% of black people said the story raises important issues about race, while 37% of white people felt that way.

• 65% of black people think the police response to protests is too much, while 33% of white people felt that way.

• 18% of black people said they have a “great deal/fair amount” of confidence in the investigations into the shooting, while 53% of white people felt that way.

More white people thought the issue of race was getting too much attention in July 2013 after a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Then, 28% of white people said the story raised important issues about race, compared to the 37% who feel that way about the {Michael Brown shooting.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting"">.

18 Aug 2014 14:52: Medical examiner Michael Baden said Michael Brown {could have survived all of the gun shots he suffered except for one}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/michael-brown-autopsy-teenager-surrendering-ferguson""> that hit the top of his head, reports The Guardian’s {Jon Swaine,}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jonswaine""> who has been in Ferguson for eight days.

Dr Michael Baden, who carried out the autopsy, said that “there weren’t signs of a struggle” on Brown’s body. Police have said that Brown assaulted Wilson after the officer stopped him and a friend and told them to walk on the sidewalk rather than in the road on 9 August.
However Baden, the former chief medical examiner for New York City, was more cautious than the lawyers, stating that the findings in his preliminary report “could be consistent” with suggestions that Brown had been shot while charging at Wilson. “It’s possible,” he said.
“There are many different witness testimonies,” said Baden. “Many seem to line up in one direction, some in another direction. Right now until we get more information we can’t, from a forensic science point of view, can’t distinguish and can’t make an absolute judgment.”

18 Aug 2014 14:38: {Guardian columnist Steven Thrasher}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/thrasherxy""> is also on the ground in Ferguson. He spoke with children there about the unrest.

When I asked six-year-old Amor, who wants to be a firefighter and who lives here in {Ferguson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> Missouri, what he thinks of the police, he said, “They shoot people.”
The children of Ferguson have an especially painful – and unfairly adult – task before them: they must make sense of the death of one of their peers, Michael Brown, and deal with the fallout from the protests, violence and militarized police presence that has, in many ways, quickly come to define their young lives in the week since Brown’s violent death at the hands of a local police officer.
The police response to protests in Ferguson has affected children as much as the death itself. Amor’s 11-year-old brother, Tavier, told me, “They shouldn’t shoot people for protesting.” Sitting over pizza just a few blocks from the Ferguson Police Department, he added, “As I was getting older, I thought police were nice people, and as I’m getting older, I’m thinking they’re so-so. They’re still good people, but they’re judging us now.”

18 Aug 2014 14:24: President Barack Obama met with attorney general Eric Holder on Monday to get updates on the situation in Ferguson. The Guardian’s Washington bureau chief {Dan Roberts}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/RobertsDan""> {reports:}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/obama-briefed-ferguson-pressure-federal-response"">

President Barack Obama’s plan to break from his vacation and return to Washington for official meetings was hatched more than four days before the lethal police shooting in Ferguson that came to overshadow so much of his first week in Martha’s Vineyard.
But unforeseen as it must have been, the opportunity to deal with the crisis from the White House rather than the backdrop of golf courses and beaches presents a chance for the president to inject greater urgency into the administration’s response.
For despite protestations to the contrary from his advisers, the president has at times appeared far removed from events unfolding on the streets of Ferguson.

18 Aug 2014 13:51: Missouri governor Jay Nixon has abandoned the curfew in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> as the national guard assists the government’s response to the protests.

“Last night, Ferguson, Missouri experienced a very difficult and dangerous night as a result of a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community,” {Nixon said in a statement.}<hyperlink=""https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/statement-gov-nixon-regarding-ongoing-situation-ferguson-and-role-national-guard""> “As long as there are vandals and looters and threats to the people and property of Ferguson, we must take action to protect our citizens.”

“The Guard’s immediate and limited responsibilities under the direction of colonel Ron Replogle of the {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> state highway patrol, are to provide protection, and ensure the safety of our Unified Command Center, which was the target last night of a coordinated attack. The Guard will concentrate its resources on carrying out this limited mission.”

He said that with these additional resources, the law enforcement agencies already operating in Ferguson will continue to respond to the protests. Missouri national guard brigadier general Gregory Mason is overseeing guard operations in Ferguson under the overall command of the state’s highway patrol.

18 Aug 2014 13:41: The St Louis City chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) held a press conference on Monday afternoon about the protests. The group has been working with the department of justice since day one of the protests and is also liaising with Michael Brown’s family.

Chapter president Adolphus Pruitt called for government officials to provide resources to businesses and social services to families in the protest zones. He said the families “already, socio-economically, are not at the highest level” and probably need the most help out of anyone affected. He also requested that the local police “enlighten us to what’s happening with the investigation.”

“Number one, we need the investigation to conclude and for justice to Mike Brown to occur,” Pruitt said. He said his other priorities included getting children back into school and ending the chaos that has overtaken Ferguson’s streets.

He said pictures of tear gas and armored vehicles against protesters has “haunted all of us,” and was concerned what would happen next if order is not restored. “The next image I see is African American men taking on the American armed forces directly, that is not the image we want to see,” said Pruitt.

18 Aug 2014 13:17: As our live blog coverage continues, here’s a summary of where things stand:

• Sunday was the eighth, and most intense, night of protests since unarmed teenager Michael Brown was killed by police on 9 August. Witnesses {reported the use}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-michael-brown-national-guard-deployed""> of tactical equipment including stun grenades, bricks and gas bombs.

• Missouri governor Jay Nixon has {called in the state’s national guard}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-michael-brown-national-guard-deployed""> to assist with the government’s response to the conflict in Ferguson. He did not tell the president he was calling in the troops, according to reports.

• Attorneys for Michael Brown’s family and the forensic scientists who conducted a private, preliminary autopsy on his body spoke at a press conference on Monday morning. Medical examiner Michael Baden said {more information is needed}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-national-guard-protests-updates#block-53f21724e4b0d0d62bdb7368""> to determine the circumstances around Brown’s death, but was able to confirm that Brown was struck by six bullets, including two to his head.

• The US Department of Justice said on Sunday that it would be {conducting its own autopsy with a federal medical examiner.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-michael-brown-shot-multiple-times-autopsy-shows-including-in-head""> Baden said this is an unusual moved for the federal government but speaks to the civil rights issues at hand in the case.

• {Brown’s mother said in an interview with ABC News}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-national-guard-protests-updates#block-53f22d56e4b01af8c1288ca6""> that Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed her son, needed to be held accountable for his actions if order it to be restored in Ferguson.

• The Ferguson-Florissant school district {postponed the first day of school}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-national-guard-protests-updates#block-53f22247e4b0f5010eeddb32""> for the second time in one week because of social unrest in the community. The district said its concerns include “children walking to school or waiting for buses on streets impacted by this activity, debris on the roads that could impact transportation.”

18 Aug 2014 12:44: The mother of Michael Brown said that the police officer who shot and killed her son must be held accountable for his actions to restore order in Ferguson {in an interview with ABC News on Monday.}<hyperlink=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/michael-browns-mother-sees-justice-restoring-peace-ferguson/story?id=25020028""> No charges have been filed against the officer, Darren Wilson, who {reportedly left town}<hyperlink=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/15/at-darren-wilsons-house-neighbors-say-he-and-his-family-took-off/""> before his name was released.

“Arresting this man and making him accountable for his actions; that’s justice,” said his mother, Lesley McSpadden.

McSpadden said she spoke Sunday with Missouri state highway patrolman Ron Johnson, who was brought in as part of {an attempt to subdue the protests.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/17/ron-johnson-ferguson-cop-middle-road-critics"">

“He had a heartfelt message for me, and it was that that could have been his son, and he was sorry, and he’s, like everybody else, supporting and hoping and praying that this doesn’t happen again,” McSpadden said.

18 Aug 2014 12:32: Missouri governor Jay Nixon did not tell the White House that he was calling in the national guard, an administration official was reported to have told journalists on Monday, reports The Guardian’s {Dan Roberts.}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/RobertsDan"">

“Folks didn’t know,” {BuzzFeed quoted one administration official as revealing.}<hyperlink=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/white-house-did-not-know-national-guard-was-being-deployed-i#3zosis3""> “The White House did not know they were sending it in.”
Though not required by law because {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> guard troops are under the command of state governor Jay Nixon, a lack of prior warning would be an embarrassment to the president who has repeatedly stressed how his administration is paying close attention to the way local authorities are handling the crisis despite it falling during the president’s vacation in Martha’s Vineyard.
Attorney general Eric Holder had previously urged a demilitarisation of the response by police in Ferguson, allegedly telling his deputies on Thursday to “tell them to remove the damn tanks”, {according to the Wall Street Journal.}<hyperlink=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/federal-authorities-wade-deeper-into-teens-death-1408322176"">
Six separate arms of Holder’s Department of Justice are involved in the crisis, including a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into possible civil rights violations in the killing of Michael Brown, and Holder is due to give Obama an update on the situation in the White House on Monday afternoon as both men returned to Washington for meetings.
The White House did not immediately respond to requests on Monday to clarify how much warning it had received of governor Nixon’s decision on Sunday night to request a national guard deployment in {Ferguson.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson"">

18 Aug 2014 12:17: Reporters have been monitoring a {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> national guard base all morning following state governor Jay Nixon’s order to deploy its troops to Ferguson. They are reporting that the first round of Humvees are leaving the base.

18 Aug 2014 12:02: The Ferguson-Florissant school district postponed the first day of school for the second time in a week on Sunday night, due to the unrest in {Ferguson.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson"">

“Information we have received from officials on the scene late Sunday evening has contributed to concerns we have about children walking to school or waiting for buses on streets impacted by this activity, debris on the roads that could impact transportation, and continued disruption affecting our students and families in the area,” {the district said on its website.}<hyperlink=""http://www.fergflor.org/pages/Ferguson-Florissant_SD"">

Classes were supposed to begin last week, but the start day was postponed to Monday, 18 August. The district announced last night that classes would not be in session today.

18 Aug 2014 11:45: {Al-Jazeera America examined}<hyperlink=""http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/8/18/st-louis-segregation.html""> how geographic, cultural and economic segregation has affected St Louis and the suburb of Ferguson. Cynthia Broadway, an African-American Ferguson resident who has been at the protests, told Al-Jazeera she has never trusted white people.

“I genuinely never thought white people cared that much about us. I always thought white people looked down at us, thought we didn’t want to work and weren’t good enough, no matter how much we dressed up. I guess I’ve kind of built up not a dislike but a stand-off type of thing, because the city is so divided. North is black, and south and west are white. I really don’t interact with white people unless it’s business. And I’ve grown up like this my entire life.”

18 Aug 2014 11:23: Baden said that it is unusual for the federal government to get involved in cases like Brown’s and that they are conducting an independent autopsy speaks to the civil rights issues at hand in the case.

“Rarely, as I recall, has the president got involved,” said Baden, who has been a forensic pathologist for more than fifty years.

He said the defense should be provided access to Michael Brown’s clothing, which would be useful for the autopsy because it could be tested for things like bullet powder residue. More forensic information is needed before the accuracy of witnesses testimonies could be determined.

Baden said “there weren’t signs of a struggle,” and abrasions on the right side of Brown’s face likely occurred after he was shot and fell to the ground.

18 Aug 2014 11:11: Medical examiner Dr Michael Baden, who conducted the preliminary autopsy and was the chief medical examiner in New York City, said it is common for families of people killed by police to seek a private autopsy because of distrust in government officials. He said that the chief medical examiner in St Louis is “an excellent forensic pathologist,” but emphasized the need to release information on the autopsy.

“What we found in New York City, is the sooner the information goes out, the sooner the family is talked to – the family has a right to know how their loved one died – this calms the community,” Baden said.

“Very simple things are found on day one of the autopsy,” he said. Baden said information about how many bullet wounds the victim received and how much suffering they endured, typically the primary concerns of the family, can be determined on day one.

18 Aug 2014 10:58: Michael Brown’s family, their attorneys and the medical examiner who {conducted a preliminary autopsy}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-national-guard-protests-updates#block-53f207bee4b0f5010eeddb0e""> on behalf of Brown’s family, are speaking to press at Greater St Mark Missionary Baptist Church in St Louis.

Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing the family of Michael Brown, said that more witness accounts were needed to provide the full story of Brown’s shooting.

“What does this preliminary account [the autopsy] tell us? That the witness accounts were true,” Crump said. “That he was shot multiple times.”

He said the family wanted a private autopsy performed because they did not want the only autopsy to be conducted by St Louis law enforcement agencies “– the same officials they think are responsible for executing their son in broad daylight,” said Crump.

He stressed that it was a preliminary report, but answered the family’s first question about their son’s death: “how many times was he shot?” He was shot at least six times, according to the autopsy.

18 Aug 2014 10:17: The Guardian’s {Jon Swaine}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jonswaine""> and {Rory Carroll}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/rorycarroll72""> are in Ferguson reporting on the protests. {Their latest dispatch}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-michael-brown-national-guard-deployed""> includes details on the use of high-pitched sirens and stun grenades during the overnight protests as people looted stores and vandalized buildings:

Police drove protesters with more gas northwards towards a burned out petrol station that was looted last Sunday. Some protesters smashed the windows of a hair salon and a storage facility as they passed. Then a burst of gunfire was heard over the road from the petrol station, sending people scrambling to the ground.
Protesters said they had no intention of backing down. “This is a revo-fucking-lution,” said DeAndre Smith, a 30-year-old barber. “Plain and simple, this is the revolution. The one everybody was waiting on. It happened like this. It’s the gain in culture by a people who want respect. African American people in this country.
“I been out here since day one. I was on the frontline. Mike Brown was the straw that broke the camel’s back. That’s when we said this is enough. That’s it.”
Following a standoff at the petrol station, police sent remaining demonstrators scrambling into side streets by speeding at them in armoured Swat trucks, firing yet more gas and smoke at people running away. The trucks continued driving up and down the main street doing this until it was cleared. As some reached a branch of Domino’s pizza, there were two more bursts of gunshots.

18 Aug 2014 10:04: Each of the at least six bullets shot at Michael Brown were fired at the front of his body, according preliminary autopsy results {reported by The New York Times on Sunday night.}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=LedeSumLargeMedia&module=a-lede-package-region&region=lede-package&WT.nav=lede-package&_r=1"">

The bullets did not appear to be fired from close range, according to the report by Dr Michael M Baden, the former chief medical examiner for New York City who was flown into {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> at the request of Brown’s family. He said that the close range assessment could be amended if there is gunshot residue on Brown’s clothing, which Baden did not have access to.

Baden said more information was needed to determine {the context of the shooting.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-michael-brown-shot-multiple-times-autopsy-shows-including-in-head"">

“This one here looks like his head was bent downward,” Baden said, indicating the wound at the very top of Brown’s head. “It can be because he’s giving up, or because he’s charging forward at the officer.”

Baden, Brown’s family and their attorney are set to host a press conference at 9:30am CST/10:30am ET.

18 Aug 2014 09:39: Welcome to our live coverage on the protests in Ferguson, Missouri. State governor Jay Nixon said early Monday morning that the National Guard {is to be deployed}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-michael-brown-national-guard-deployed""> to Ferguson following a week of protests in response to the shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown.

The announcement was made following the eighth, and most intense, night of unrest since Brown was killed on 9 August. {Nixon said in the order}<hyperlink=""https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/following-coordinated-attacks-civilians-and-law-enforcement-governor-nixon-signs""> that he was directing troops to the northern suburb of St Louis because of the “deliberate, coordinated and intensifying violent attacks on lives and property in Ferguson.”

“These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory, and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served, and to feel safe in their own homes.”

As gunfire rang through the city on Sunday night and police used teargas and rubber bullets on crowds, {The New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=LedeSumLargeMedia&module=a-lede-package-region&region=lede-package&WT.nav=lede-package&_r=1""> reported the results of a preliminary autopsy of Brown’s body, showing that police officer Darren Wilson shot Brown at least six times, including twice in the head.

The Department of Justice said on Sunday it is taking the unusual step of ordering a third autopsy by a federal medical examiner. The agency is also leading a civil-rights investigation into the killing.

14 Aug 2014 18:02: We’re going to wrap up our live blog coverage for now, possibly to resume later tonight.

We will continue coverage of events in Ferguson on our home page {here.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us""> Jon Swaine is in Ferguson and will file a report later this evening – you can follow Jon on Twitter {@jonswaine.}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jonswaine"">

Here’s a summary of where things stand:

• Protesters began to gather for a fifth night Thursday evening in Ferguson to demand answers in the 9 August police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Police have yet to name the officer involved or to release an incident report.

• Police said they would use a new plan of operation in the streets Thursday night, designed to deescalate confrontations with protesters and encourage dialogue.

• Missouri Governor Jay Nixon announced the state patrol would be taking the lead in the police effort, replacing the St Louis County police department.

• The officer leading tonight’s patrol, Capt. Ron Johnson, said he would be out talking to protesters: “When we talk about boots on the ground, my boots are going to be on the ground.”

• The changes followed a night of clashes Wednesday in which police used rubber bullets and tear gas on peaceful protesters. At least 10 people were arrested Wednesday.

• President Barack Obama took a break from his vacation to address the situation Thursday afternoon. He called on all sides “to take a step back and think about how we’re going to be moving forward.”

•  “There is never an excuse for violence against police,” said Obama. “...There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests.”

• Attorney general Eric Holder said federal investigators had interviewed eyewitnesses to the killing of Michael Brown and that a full account of what happened would emerge. The county is conducting a separate probe.

• Saint Louis county executive Charlie Dooley asked people to calm down. “This ought not to be a black and white thing,” he said. “We can do better than this.”

14 Aug 2014 17:08: In a {piece for Comment Is Free,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/14/ferguson-occupation-peace-calm""> Roxane Gay writes that Ferguson is “an occupation happening in plain sight” and a display of police power run amok:

{Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> is the site of an occupation happening in plain sight, and the police remain undeterred because they can occupy, because they know they have unlimited power, because they know they cannot be stopped.
I am stunned but I should not be. I recognize the luxury of my disbelief. I will never allow myself such luxury again. Today, I truly understand privilege.
I am outraged but I do not know what to do with my outrage that might be productive, that might move this world forward toward a place where black lives matter, and where black parents no longer need to {have “the talk” with their children}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/mike-brown-ferguson-shooting-police-black""> about how not to be killed by police and where anger over a lifetime of wrongs is not judged, but understood and supported.

Read the {full piece here.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/14/ferguson-occupation-peace-calm"">

14 Aug 2014 17:04: The Guardian Jessica Glenza ({@jessicaglenza}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/JessicaGlenza"">) has spoken with Missouri Rep Emanuel Cleaver II about the events in Ferguson. Cleaver’s district is across the state in Kansas City, where he used to be mayor.

“Something is wrong in Ferguson, and it didn’t just start with the killing of Michael Brown,” Cleaver said. “It took that killing to bring the light of inadequacy on that community’s leadership.”

Jessica reports:

Asked whether he thought that statements issued by US leaders, including President Obama and Senator Claire McCaskill, were helpful in defusing the situation, Cleaver said, “The president did the right thing, but understand the two things that are still hanging out there that must be dealt with, first of all until the police department or the city prosecutor makes a statement there is going to be this intense suspicion which creates anger.”
As for armored vehicles and other military-style equipment appearing on {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> streets, Cleaver said, “We need to reevaluate distributing this kind of equipment to municipalities. And if we’re going to do it we at least must have other requirements, including something as simple as training.”

“Just think about it – the same equipment we’ve used to fight in Iraq we put on the streets of Ferguson, {Missouri,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri"">” Cleaver said. “That’s shameful.”

14 Aug 2014 16:59: The Guardian’s Jon Swaine ({@jonswaine}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jonswaine"">), who attended the news conference with Governor Jay Nixon, flags a key line:

Promising a “softer front”, Nixon said: “Attitudes weren’t improving, and the blocks toward expression appeared to be a flashpoint”.

14 Aug 2014 16:48: Capt Johnson is asked what he will do differently tonight. Will he used armor vehicles and body armor?

“We’re going to go back and assess today,” he says. “When we talk about boots on the ground, my boots are going to be on the ground.”

He says he’ll go to the QuikTrip that burned down and meet with people there himself.

He says they won’t “take resources out there that we don’t need.”

He says they want to “hear people speak... not just let them speak but listening.”

14 Aug 2014 16:47: Nixon is asked about his relationship with the black community. He replies:

“I appreciate the relationship I have with so many friends over so many years in this community... I tremendously appreciate that.
I’m going to continue to not use this as a time to divide... or to see how loud I can talk.
People have first amendment rights, I’ve got executive challenges here.”

He says there should be room for people to publicly disagree.

He’s asked about criticism on Twitter – and one specific criticism apparently involving a “four-letter word”. He replies:

“I try to put gasoline into the engine of fire engines when I see them. Not on the fires. I feel that is more productive.”

14 Aug 2014 16:43: Nixon says the justice department and St Louis County investigations are hustling ahead.

“I think we let them do their jobs. I know they’re hustling their tails off.”

14 Aug 2014 16:41: Nixon is asked how he wants to heal the “deeper wound” he {referred to.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/14/erguson-protests-police-crackdown-michael-brown-shooting#block-53ed1dc2e4b038fb92169a6f"">

“We’re focused on operational things,” he says. “We’d like to see the danger level go down on a lot of fronts. We’d like to see the investigations that are out there get completed.
It’s really important for people to know what happened and how it happened.”

14 Aug 2014 16:39: Nixon is asked about the problem of persistent racial profiling of black residents of the St Louis area, including traffic stops and other reported harrassment.

Nixon replies that the situation touches a “deeper nerve”:

“This feels a little like an old wound that has been hit again. And so the pain you feel... it feels like a little bit of a longtime simmering. And that I think is natural for all of us to see and to watch.
The key to this is to get control, let voices be heard, make sure we protect property... showing less force on the front side, but ultimately getting to some of these deeper problems.
These are deep and existing problems not only in {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> but in America... it touches a deeper nerve.
I think ultimately we will be graded or gauged as to whether or not this was an opportunity used to be able to make some longer term understanding..”

14 Aug 2014 16:36: Nixon is asked whether he will look into the arrest and jailing of peaceful protesters Wednesday.

“There’s been gunfire... let’s not kid ourselves folks, this has been a difficult zone.
I think tonight you’ll see... an attempt ... to move forward people and to move back a little bit of equipment.”

14 Aug 2014 16:34: The challenge we face today is not whether we have enough officers or have shown enough strength on the police side, Nixon says.

“We’ve shown that.”

But he says business owners and others would be protected from “illegal acts.”

14 Aug 2014 16:32: Nixon calls releasing officer's name 'important milestone'

Nixon says he doesn’t know the name of the officer who killed Michael Brown.

“I would hold that the appropriate release of that name... would be done as expeditiously as possible” as long as there’s appropriate security, he says.

“I think it would be an important milestone to get that out as expeditiously as possible.”

14 Aug 2014 16:30: Nixon is asked who was in charge of the heavy-handed police presence Wednesday, armor, assault rifles, camo and all.

“That was yesterday. Tonight is tonight. Tomorrow is tomorrow.
Our hope is that this operation shift will begin the process of lowering the intensity of those direct interactions and potential risks... while at the same time allowing people to speak.”

The reporter persists: who was in charge?

“I’m not looking backwards,” Nixon says. “I’m looking forward.”

14 Aug 2014 16:26: Nixon:

“All of us have seen some level of escalation... in terms of the arms that were used as well as some of the conduct.”

He calls for a “dimming” of that escalation.

He says “clearly you’ll see as the afternoon-evening starts, a different picture... Clearly, the strong force on the front line, our hopes would be that we have the ability to get a little more peaceful interaction on the front.”

14 Aug 2014 16:27: Nixon:

“I  think we all have been concerned about the vision that the world has seen about this region. And I think we’re all about making sure that we allow peaceful... protests, that we use force only when necessary, that we step back a little bit and allow some of the energy to be felt in this region appropriately...
I think you’re going to see... I think that while maintaining the peace, but allowing more movement, trying to bring in a different how should we say a different tone of the amplitude of the protective force, my sense is that... people on the ground are working on some of those changes anyway.”

14 Aug 2014 16:25: Slay thanks St Louis County PD officers and others in the streets. “I want to thank you for your service. Thank you for respecting the badge, for honoring your oath.”

14 Aug 2014 16:25: St Louis mayor Francis Slay speaks.

He says Michael Brown’s family, friends, and this community “are all in mourning.”

Slay calls for a full, fair and transparent investigation” and “for justice to be served.”

He says the leaders are in “common agreement”:

“Justice must happen, the grieving must be comforted, the angry must be heard and the innocent must be protected.”

14 Aug 2014 16:22: Saint Louis county executive Charlie Dooley says he’s for justice, not revenge.

He said the community needs to “calm down, stand down and let’s be reasonable. Let’s have a conversation. How do we perceive ourselves? How does the world look at us as a coomunity?

“This ought not to be a black and white thing... we can do better than this.”

14 Aug 2014 16:17: Capt Johnson is speaking.

“I appreciate the significance of this responsibility, he says. “I grew up here, and this is currently my community and my home.”

He says it’s a priority to build trust and maintain communication with residents.

“I understand the anger and fear that the citizens of {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> are feeling, and our police officers will respect both of those,” he says.

14 Aug 2014 16:15: Nixon removes county police in favor of state patrol

Missouri Highway Patrol under Ron Johnson, who grew up in this area, will direct the law enforcement team, Nixon says.

The St Louis County police department is apparently out of the leadership.

14 Aug 2014 16:14: Nixon is speaking. He thanks the University of {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> St Louis which is hosting the conference.

He says he was briefed this morning and spoke with the president.

He says he has met with faith and civic leaders and visited the scene.

He says he appreciated the opportunity to speak with members of the neighborhood, who said they want peace.

“My message to the people of {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> is that these voices have been heard.
What’s been going on here the last few days is not what Missouri’s about... but lately it’s been more like a war zone.”

14 Aug 2014 16:09: NBC News has a camera on the Nixon news conference, yet to begin:

14 Aug 2014 16:01: The Missouri governor is due to speak soon.

14 Aug 2014 15:27: A Democratic congressman plans to introduce a bill to restrict a Defense Department program that provides machine guns and other surplus military equipment for free to local law enforcement agencies across the US, the AP reports:

Rep. Hank Johnson said the legislation is in response to the death of an unarmed teenager who was shot by a police officer in a St. Louis suburb.
Johnson said city streets should be a place for businesses and families, “not tanks and M16s.” He said a Pentagon program that transfers surplus military equipment to state and local law enforcement has led to police agencies resembling paramilitary forces.
“Militarizing America’s main streets won’t make us any safer, just more fearful and more reticent,” Johnson said. He said his bill would limit the type of military equipment that can be transferred to law enforcement, and require states to certify they can account for all equipment received.

14 Aug 2014 15:10: Holder: federal investigators have interviewed witnesses

Federal investigators have “already conducted interviews with eyewitnesses on the scene at the time of the shooting incident on Saturday,” attorney general Holder said at the end of his {statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/14/erguson-protests-police-crackdown-michael-brown-shooting#block-53ed0662e4b0d0d62bdb711a""> Thursday.

Those investigators come from the civil rights division of the department of justice and the U.S. attorney’s office in {Missouri.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri"">

“Our review will take time to conduct, but it will be thorough and fair,” Holder said.

14 Aug 2014 15:05: A defense department spokesman said a program to give secondhand military gear to local law enforcement was “useful” and prevented waste.

Here are remarks by Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, via Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman ({@attackerman}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/attackerman"">):

“There is a law enforcement support program that the Defense Department administers which provides to law enforcement agencies around the country surplus military equipment, gear, arms, ammunition, vehicles. This is a useful program that allows for the re-use of military equipment that otherwise would be disposed of that can be used again by law enforcement agencies to serve their citizens. The program serves a purpose.
“That said, it is up to law enforcement agencies to speak to how and what they gain through this system, and I’m not going to inject the Pentagon into this discussion. How this equipment is used to serve local citizens is up for local law enforcement agencies to speak to.”

14 Aug 2014 14:59: Holder: these scenes 'cannot continue'

Attorney General Eric Holder {released}<hyperlink=""http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/August/14-ag-854.html""> a statement Thursday following his meeting with President Obama to discuss the latest developments in Ferguson:

“This morning, I met with President Obama to discuss the events in Ferguson, Missouri. Like the President, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of Michael Brown. While his death has understandably caused heartache within the community, it is clear that the scenes playing out in the streets of {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> over the last several nights cannot continue.
“For one thing, while the vast majority of protests have been peaceful, acts of violence by members of the public cannot be condoned. Looting and willful efforts to antagonize law enforcement officers who are genuinely trying to protect the public do nothing to remember the young man who has died. Such conduct is unacceptable and must be unequivocally condemned.
“By the same token, the law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them. Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.
“At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message. At my direction, Department officials have conveyed these concerns to local authorities. Also at my direction, the Department is offering – through our COPS office and Office of Justice Programs – technical assistance to local authorities in order to help conduct crowd control and maintain public safety without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force. The local authorities in {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> have accepted this offer of assistance as of this afternoon.
“Department officials from the Community Relations Service are also on the ground in Missouri to help convene law enforcement officials and civic and faith leaders to plot out steps to reduce tensions in the community. The latest such meeting was convened in Ferguson as recently as this morning. Over time, these conversations should consider the role that increased diversity in law enforcement can play in helping to build trust within communities.
“All the while, the federal civil rights investigation into the shooting incident itself continues, in parallel with the local investigation into state law violations. Our investigators from the Civil Rights Division and U.S. attorney’s office in Missouri have already conducted interviews with eyewitnesses on the scene at the time of the shooting incident on Saturday. Our review will take time to conduct, but it will be thorough and fair.”

14 Aug 2014 14:42: As our live blog coverage continues, here’s a summary of where things stand:

• Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said there would be a change in the “tone” of law enforcement in Ferguson. “We’re working through a number of operational things to make some shifts,” he said.

• Nixon was expected to give details at a news conference at 3pm Central / 4pm Eastern.

• The use of rubber bullets, tear gas and military-grade armor and weaponry Wednesday night against demonstrators protesting the police killing last Saturday of 18-year-old Michael Brown drew national outrage. 

• “Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we’ve seen,” President Barack Obama said in a statement on the crackdown.

• Obama said there was “no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests.” He also said “there is never an excuse for violence against police.”

• Political leaders asked a community demanding answers about the killing of Brown to wait until a county attorney’s investigation was complete. “The facts will become known, all of them,” Senator Claire McCaskill said.

• Obama said he had tasked the Justice Department and the FBI to investigate the death of Michael Brown and that he was personally receiving updates.

• Read the {previous summary here.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/14/erguson-protests-police-crackdown-michael-brown-shooting#block-53ece238e4b06c461acbb481"">

14 Aug 2014 14:17: Full text of Obama statement on Ferguson

Here is President Barack Obama’s statement on {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> in full, via the White House press shop:

“Now, second, I want to address something that’s been in the news over the last couple of days and that’s the situation in Ferguson, {Missouri.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> I know that many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we’ve seen in the heartland of our country, as police have clashed with people protesting. Today, I’d like us all to take a step back and think about how we’re going to be moving forward.
“This morning, I received a thorough update on the situation from Attorney General Eric Holder, who has been following it and been in communication with his team. I’ve already tasked the Department of Justice and the FBI to independently investigate the death of Michael Brown, along with local officials on the ground.
“The Department of Justice is also consulting with local authorities about ways that they can maintain public safety without restricting the right of peaceful protest and while avoiding unnecessary escalation. I made clear to the Attorney General that we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened, and to see that justice is done.
“I also just spoke with Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri. I expressed my concern over the violent turn that events have taken on the ground, and underscored that now is the time for all of us to reflect on what’s happened, and to find a way to come together going forward. He is going to be traveling to Ferguson. He is a good man and a fine governor, and I’m confident that, working together, he is going to be able to communicate his desire to make sure that justice is done and his desire to make sure that public safety is maintained in an appropriate way.
“Of course, it’s important to remember how this started. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old. His family will never hold Michael in their arms again. And when something like this happens, the local authorities –- including the police -– have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death, and how they are protecting the people in their communities.
“There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. And here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground. Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority.
“I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened. There are going to be different accounts of how this tragedy occurred. There are going to be differences in terms of what needs to happen going forward. That’s part of our democracy. But let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law; a basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest; a reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman and child among us; and the need for accountability when it comes to our government.
“So now is the time for healing. Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done. And I’ve asked that the Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney on the scene continue to work with local officials to move that process forward. They will be reporting to me in the coming days about what’s being done to make sure that happens.”

14 Aug 2014 13:56: {Missouri}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/missouri""> Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, is speaking to reporters.

She says it’s appropriate not to release information about the investigation into the killing of Michael Brown until the probe is complete.

“The information will become public. The facts will become known, all of them. I’m not going to second-guess law enforcement... about information they are giving out. Because I know they are [aiming] to make sure they find the truth.”

14 Aug 2014 13:52: Reporting from Ferguson, the Guardian’s Jon Swaine ({@jonswaine}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jonswaine"">) has spoken again with St Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman about criticism that the law enforcement response has been heavy handed.

“Luckily for both sides, there’s been no lethal force used,” Schellman tells Jon:

“But what has been used is things like molotov cocktails. Those are deadly weapons. So the police response to the molotov cocktails was less lethal munitions. We’re not using deadly force when a deadly force molotov cocktail was used on us.”

Schellman could not confirm that any molotov cocktails or bottles had actually struck any officers.

“But does that make it OK for people to throw? I don’t know,” he said. “To me it doesn’t. It doesn’t make it OK. To say ‘it doesn’t really matter because they didn’t hurt any of the officers’, we can’t think like that.
“So, do we have to wait until one of our officers gets hurt? That’s the big question here.” Asked if he meant that the answer was “no,” Schellman said: “Absolutely.”

Speaking late on Wednesday night at the police command centre, Schellman said officers had used “as much restraint as we could given the situation.”

14 Aug 2014 13:48: The military force brought to bear by the police in Ferguson is “a stark illustration of the {militarization of police forces}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/24/military-us-police-swat-teams-raids-aclu""> in the US, {write}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-military-restraints-violence-weaponry-missouri""> the Guardian’s Jon Swaine ({@jonswaine}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/jonswaine"">) in Ferguson and Amanda Holpuch ({@holpuch}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/holpuch"">) in New York:

“I’m a soldier, I’m a military officer and I know when there’s a need for such thing, but I don’t think in a small town of 22,000 people you need up-armor vehicles,” Cristian Balan, a communications officer in the US army, who was not speaking on behalf of the US military, told the Guardian. “Even if there’s an active shooter – are you really going to use an up-armor vehicle? Do you really need it?”
In the eyes of the government, the answer increasingly seems to be a resounding yes.

A senior counsel with the ACLU tells the Guardian that the militarization of police contributes to violence instead of detracting from it:

“As we’ve seen in Ferguson, the militarization of policing tends to escalate the risk of violence to the communities,”said Kara Dansky, senior counsel with the ACLU’s Center for Justice and the prime author of its June 2014 {report on the militarization of US police.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/24/military-us-police-swat-teams-raids-aclu""> “We think that historically, the police and the military have had different roles and that American neighborhoods aren’t war zones and police officers should not be treating us like wartime enemies.”

14 Aug 2014 13:39: Senator Rand Paul calls in Time magazine for the de-militarization of US police forces. “There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement,” he writes:

“Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement. [...]
When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.”

Read the {full piece here.}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> Update: Dylan Scott in Talking Points Memo reports the Ferguson police received military gear direct from the Pentagon “through what’s known as the 1033 program, a federal program that the ACLU says has been a key catalyst to the broader escalation of law enforcement force in the United States”:

“The 1033 program, which was approved by Congress in 1992 to help law enforcement fight the war on drugs and was expanded in 1997, allows police departments to request and receive refurbished military equipment from the U.S. Defense Department free of charge.”

14 Aug 2014 13:30: Jackson is answering questions about why law enforcement has not released the identity of the officer who killed Brown. He brings up possible charges in the case, saying county attorney McCullough’s policy is “not to release somebody’s name until they are formally charged.”

14 Aug 2014 13:28: Jackson says county prosecutor Robert McCullough will continue to gather evidence in the killing of Michael Brown to be presented to a grand jury when it’s ready. He mentions toxicology reports. It will take some time, Jackson says.

14 Aug 2014 13:26: “If individuals are in a crowd that’s attacking police, they need to get out of that crowd,” Jackson says. He says police cannot individually quiz protesters as to whether they are violent.

He says “the media’s not a target.”

14 Aug 2014 13:24: Ferguson chief: 'We have to respond to deadly force'

{Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> police chief Thomas Jackson is holding a news conference.

He says that police will attempt to “facilitate” the protests tonight, and he wants the protesters to realize that the law enforcement goal is “facilitation.”

“We’re going to have cones, things like that. We’re not going to have barricades...we’re asking for cooperation,” he says.

Jackson is asked if armored vehicles will be used.

“The tactical units will be out there. If [there are] firebombs, property getting destroyed...we have to respond to deadly force.”

14 Aug 2014 13:18: Huffington Post journalist Ryan Reilly, who was detained by police in Ferguson Wednesday with Washington Post journalist Wesley Lowery, has posted to YouTube video {that he shot}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/499965428589142018""> after the two were released.

In the video the journalists ask police for information about their arrest – which is roundly denied. Police told them there was no report in their arrest and that they, the police, could not help the journalists get the names of the arresting officer or any other official account of why they were taken into custody. 

14 Aug 2014 12:58: Obama says it’s important not to forget how the events in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> began– “we lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old and his family will never hold Michael in their arms again.”

“Local authorities have a responsibility to be open and transparent,” he says.

“There is never an excuse for violence against police... or looting,” Obama says.

But, he says, “There is also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for.. exercising their First Amendment rights.”

And “here in the United States of American police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs...

“I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson. And there are certainly passionate differences about what is happening. There are different accounts.”

Obama says he expects further reports in the coming days from law enforcement at the scene.

He exits without taking questions.

14 Aug 2014 12:55: Obama: “I know that many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we’ve seen.”

He says “I’d like us all to take a step back” to figure out how we’ll move forward.

He says he’s tasked the Justice Department and the FBI to investigate the death of Michael Brown.

He says he spoke with Nixon and underscored his concern about the “violent turn of events on the ground.”

14 Aug 2014 12:50: Obama begins speaking. He says he’s been monitoring two issues closely: Iraq and {Ferguson.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson"">

He begins with a discussion of the evacuation of members of the Yazidi religious minority from Mt Sinjar in northern Iraq.

14 Aug 2014 12:47: Nixon apologizes for being late, but he was on the phone with the president.

“[Obama] said to me a number of things, not the least of which is to send he and the first lady’s wishes of peace and justice to this community,” Nixon says.

Nixon says Obama promised his assistance in any way he could do it. He wanted me “specifically to thank the faith leaders and other leaders who are leading with vigor but with peace.”

Nixon says his next announcement will be at 3p central time.

“We just can’t have lawlesssness. We’ve got to use that energy as an excuse to pushe

14 Aug 2014 12:43: Nixon: 'We are going to be making some shifts'

Missouri governor Jay Nixon is speaking in Ferguson at a church. He refers to “changes” to be made in the law enforcement response to the protests:

“We are over the next few hours going to be making some shifts so that people are feeling safe... as long as they are respecting the property of their neighbors... and the vast, vast, vast majority have done just that.”

14 Aug 2014 12:41: {John Lewis,}<hyperlink=""http://johnlewis.house.gov/""> the civil rights leader and longtime congressman from Georgia, has decried the harsh police response in Ferguson.

“People must respect the citizens,” Lewis said. “You do not refer to citizens as animals. You do not dress like you’re ready to be engaged in warfare.”

Lewis also is quoted as having called for martial law, which is hard to square with his {record of civil disobedience and leadership}<hyperlink=""https://johnlewis.house.gov/john-lewis/biography""> of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee at the height of the civil rights movement.

• The morning after a brutal police crackdown on demonstrators protesting the police killing of Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Missouri, political leaders called for restraint.

• “We need to de-militarize this situation,” multiple leaders said.

• President Barack Obama was scheduled to address the crackdown any minute and Missouri Governor Jay Nixon was scheduled to hold a news conference later Thursday.

• Police used rubber bullets, tear gas, noisemakers, flashbangs, armored vehicles and other intimidation to drive largely peaceful protests off the streets of Ferguson Wednesday night. At least 10 people were arrested, police said.

• Up to 40 law enforcement jurisdictions were involved in the Ferguson response, a St Louis paper {said.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/14/erguson-protests-police-crackdown-michael-brown-shooting#block-53ecd96be4b0f5010eedd7ec""> There was {speculation}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/aug/14/erguson-protests-police-crackdown-michael-brown-shooting#block-53ecc9e2e4b038fb92169a4b""> that the Missouri governor would announce a change in leadership in the law enforcement response.

• The ACLU has filed a petition for the police department to release its incident report in the 9 August killing of Brown, who was unarmed.

14 Aug 2014 12:17: The official account of St Louis mayor Francis Slay is tweeting about Ferguson. Because St Louis does not incorporate the many communities around it, its official population is relatively small, at 315,000. But Ferguson is part of the larger St Louis metropolitan area, with about 3m total residents.

“I question many of the tactics used in Ferguson,” Slay writes, “especially the arrest of journalists.”

[tweetbegin 499917965832093697 tweetend]

He continues:

“I have spoken to federal, MO, county officials, expressed these views and offered the city’s experience.
It is my strongest hope that subsequent events do not delay or obscure swift justice in the Michael Brown case.
In the earliest days, the influential voices belonged to Michael Brown’s parents. Let them be heeded again.
The first thing that should happen is to demilitarize the situation in Ferguson.”

As many as 40 different law enforcement jurisdictions have sent officers to assist in Ferguson, Lussenhop says:

Late Wednesday, Nixon released a statement on the situation, in which he “urge[d] law enforcement agencies to keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press”:

“The worsening situation in {Ferguson}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson""> is deeply troubling, and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans. While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern.
I have been closely monitoring the situation and will continue to be in communication with local leaders, and I will be in north St. Louis County tomorrow. As Governor, I am committed to ensuring the pain of last weekend’s tragedy does not continue to be compounded by this ongoing crisis. Once again, I ask that members of the community demonstrate patience and calm while the investigation continues, and I urge law enforcement agencies to keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press during this difficult time.”

14 Aug 2014 11:40: The rough handling by police of Ferguson residents has also been applied to reporters at the scene. Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery has described his arrest along with Huffington Post reporter Ryan Reilly as the two sat working inside a McDonalds. Police have repeatedly objected to news crews and residents filming them.

Later on Wednesday, an Al-Jazeera America crew filming a police position from a distance was hit with a tear gas canister fired to land at the base of their tripods. The gas quickly engulfs the crew, which flees. Here is {video of the attack}<hyperlink=""http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/live-news/2014/8/al-jazeera-americareportergetshitwithteargasinferguson.html""> on the Al-Jazeera crew.

14 Aug 2014 10:16: Good morning and welcome to our liveblog coverage of a police crackdown in Ferguson, Missouri, in the aftermath of the {police killing last Saturday}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/aug/12/ferguson-michael-brown-missouri-shooting-video""> of an unarmed black teenager, 18-year-old Michael Brown.

The police response to demonstrators protesting against Brown’s death escalated sharply late Wednesday, with police using tear gas, rubber bullets, flashbang devices, noisemakers and armored vehicles to scatter unarmed crowds. At least 10 people were arrested Wednesday night, police said.

The Guardian’s Jon Swaine has been in Ferguson since Monday. {Early on Thursday he described the latest violence:}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-teargas-rubber-bullets-michael-brown"">

“Dozens of officers, some carrying assault rifles, advanced with a pair of armoured trucks on the young and predominantly African American crowd, after two glass bottles were thrown at their lines from a largely peaceful protest against the shooting of Michael Brown by a city policeman.
Demonstrators, who for hours had sniper rifles trained on them while they protested with their hands up as an emblem of peaceful protest, complained that they were subjected to military-style tactics as they fled through gas-filled residential side-streets.”

Residents and outside observers have condemned the police tactics as needlessly heavy-handed. The rising chorus of protest finally drew a response from Missouri governor Jay Nixon on Wednesday just before midnight, when he said he would {skip the state fair}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/GovJayNixon/status/499763706297741313""> Thursday to visit the scene. Nixon had been criticized for remaining all but silent on the issue.

The White House said early on Thursday that Barack Obama had interrupted his vacation on Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, to be briefed by the US attorney general, Eric Holder, on the situation.

On Wednesday, Swaine {witnessed}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/ferguson-police-arrest-reporters-as-unrest-continues-over-michael-brown-shooting""> the arrest of two reporters who had been sitting at work inside a McDonalds, including one from the Washington Post. Marty Baron, the Post’s editor, condemned the arrest as “an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news.”

Ferguson, a {city of 21,000,}<hyperlink=""http://www.fergusoncity.com/""> is attached to St Louis, which has a metropolitan area of almost 3m residents. St Louis County police are leading the law enforcement response.

Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the county police, told the Guardian at the law enforcement command centre late on Wednesday that chiefs would review tactics after the night’s events.

18 Aug 2014 10:40: This webchat has been cancelled

Our apologies, but Donald Glover has cancelled all of his UK press during his tour. He gave us a single-word reason:

#ferguson

Glover has been outspoken during the {current unrest in Ferguson,}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/ferguson-missouri-michael-brown-national-guard-deployed""> posting {a series of tweets}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/donaldglover""> denouncing “Twitter activism”, as well as a multi-tweet poem in which he wryly wishes he was white. He also tweeted that “I’ve been threatened by police twice this year.”

We hope to reschedule the webchat for some point in the future – in the meantime, thanks to everyone who posted a question.

Looking at Donald Glover’s CV will make you feel tired and unspectacular.

His primary creative outlet at the moment is rapping as Childish Gambino, with his recent album Because the Internet pairing a perfectly balanced flow with psychedelically futurist production (it also had {a gif for an album cover,}<hyperlink=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Childish-gambino-because-the-internet.gif""> Tumblr fans). He’s also appeared on tracks with stadium dubstep producer Flux Pavilion, fellow internet master Riff Raff, and new-school R&B star Jhene Aiko, in {a video}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoIpx1ZxFeM""> that riffs on John and Yoko’s bed-ins.

But he’s also known for his acting, having traded saliva and racial politics with Lena Dunham in Girls, and been a central character in five seasons of cult sitcom {Community.}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/community""> He started out as a writer for 30 Rock, and he’s signed up to write and star in Atlanta, a new comedy show set against the backdrop of the city he grew up in. He also created a feature length film with his sketch comedy troupe Mystery Team.

Then there’s his standup. Comedy aficionados should check out Weirdo, his excellent hour-long special for {Comedy}<hyperlink=""http://www.theguardian.com/stage/comedy""> Central in which he tackles defecation, sugar addiction, and erotic power of the n-word, his voice bouncing elastically between different personae throughout.

He plays as Childish Gambino at London’s Brixton Academy on Tuesday 19 September – and is also coming in to answer your questions that very same day, from 1-2pm. So what do you want to ask him?
