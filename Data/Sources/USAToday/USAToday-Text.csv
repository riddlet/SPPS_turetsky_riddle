USAToday,usa1,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/ferguson-militarized-police/14064675/,Police in Ferguson ignite debate about military tactics,Marisol Bello; Yamiche Alcindor,08/19/2014,10/23/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. — The scene harkened to familiar images of the Iraq war: men in black helmets and body armor sitting on top of armored personnel carriers, rifles at the ready, surveying the civilian population.

Except this was in Middle America and the civilian population was made up of people demonstrating with their hands up to protest the police shooting of an unarmed black teen.

A day after St. Louis County Police clashed with protesters here, throwing tear gas canisters, shooting rubber bullets and using long-range acoustic weapons meant to cause ear-splitting pain, Ferguson has ignited a national debate over local police use of military-style tactics and equipment. Is it effective policing or an excessive display of force?

The St. Louis County police department, which has been patrolling Ferguson during the unrest following the death of {18-year-old Michael Brown}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827"">, has been criticized for heavy-handed tactics that include intimidating peaceful protesters.

""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a written statement Thursday. ""The law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them."" ""

Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon promised Thursday a ""different tone"" and an ""operational shift"" by police on the protest-wracked streets of Ferguson. He directed the State Highway Patrol to take over supervision of security.

Some critics say the military-style policing has worsened an already volatile situation.

""The police response needs to be demilitarized,"" said Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat. ""I think the police response has become part of the problem as opposed to being part of the solution. We've all got to take a deep breath and realize that the vast majority of people protesting have a constitutional right.""

Francis Slay, mayor of St. Louis, said the situation has been mishandled. ""It creates a higher level of anxiety and higher level of anger,"" he said. His city's government and police force are separate from neighboring St. Louis County, where Ferguson is located.

Anxiety was evident in Ferguson. Since the shooting Saturday afternoon, the St. Louis County Police SWAT unit patrolled the town dressed in fatigues, carrying automatic assault rifles and driving tanks.

The effect was a city turned war zone.

Officers faced angry protesters, some of whom destroyed parts of the city. They pointed rifles at vehicles that got too close. They yelled at reporters to duck behind their cars or risk being shot in the crossfire.

The tension reached a breaking point Wednesday when St. Louis County Police arrived with four armored trucks. Officers in gas masks and fatigues yelled at protesters to leave.

""We won't tolerate non-peaceful actions,"" an officer yelled through a loudspeaker Wednesday night. He told protesters to put down their rocks and weapons, though no rocks had been thrown and no weapons were visible. People who had been singing and playing drums grew angry and yelled back.

Sierra Smith, who lives in the apartment complex at the center of the protests, told the governor on Thursday that her neighborhood has been under police siege since Brown's death.

""Every night we're tormented,"" she said. ""The police have no respect at all for the community.""

But Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, a union that represents more than 325,000 officers nationwide, defended the actions of the Ferguson and St. Louis County police. He said he had spoken with officers there who told him they have been responding to violence from people who have looted, started fires and thrown rocks and bottles at them.

He said the police here have used as much restraint as possible, including verbal commands and non-lethal weapons such as tear gas and bean bag rounds, to break up crowds. Canterbury said a large crowd that is unruly, or appears likely to become unruly, requires a strong show of force to control it.

""You don't retreat,"" said Canterbury, a 26-year veteran of the Horry County Police Department in Conway, S.C. ""We have to protect property and we have to protect people.""

Much of the high-tech gear seen in Ferguson is to protect police, he said.

The military appearance is ""more a perception than reality,"" he said. ""They are two different things. The military is trained to engage and law enforcement is trained to defuse.""

Thomas Nolan, a 27-year veteran of the Boston Police Department who heads the criminal justice department at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, calls the pictures coming out of Ferguson a ""black mark on contemporary policing practices.

""We are are absolutely seeing the most visible manifestation possible of the militarization of police,"" he said.

The trend grew nationwide after 9/11, when police work expanded from community policing to include homeland security, but it is overkill to use armored personnel carriers, long-range acoustic weapons and other military weapons on civilians in the USA, he said.

""I predict that future law enforcement training will include this episode as how not to engage a crowd,"" Nolan said. ""This will be in every police academy in the country.""",75,1178,NA,ferguson site:usatoday.com daterange:2456878-2456889.5

Brown was {shot and killed}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/09/police-shooting-ferguson/13832083/""> Saturday afternoon by a Ferguson police officer.

Belmar said the incident started when Brown physically assaulted the police officer, pushing him into the officer's vehicle. He said there was a struggle inside the car, and at some point Brown reached for the officer's weapon. One shot was fired inside the vehicle.

Brown suffered fatal gunshot wounds outside of the vehicle, approximately 35 feet from the car. Belmar said multiple shell casings were found at the scene, and that Brown was shot more than once, but an exact number of shots fired has not yet been determined. All the shell casings came from the officer's weapon.

Belmar confirmed Brown was unarmed at the time of the shooting. He did not say what led to the struggle inside the officer's car.

Ferguson police cars do not have dash cameras, so there is no police video of the incident available for review, according to Officer Brian Schellman, a county police spokesman.

""There is no video in the apartment complex,"" Schellman added. ""We are still trying to determine if any witnesses recorded the incident.""

[tweetbegin 498253652755111937 tweetend]

The medical examiner is conducting an investigation to determine how many times Brown was shot. It will take several weeks before toxicology results are available.

After the shooting, Belmar said Ferguson Chief Tom Jackson called him and asked the county to take over the investigation.

Belmar said when the investigation is complete the findings will be turned over to the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. They will determine if charges should be filed.

On Saturday afternoon the St. Louis County NAACP {called for the FBI to investigate}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/08/09/naacp-fbi-investigate-police-shooting/13845591/""> the shooting. Belmar said the FBI could become involved later, and that it's not unusual for the FBI to become involved in cases like this.

""My son just turned 18 and graduated from high school, and he don't bother nobody,"" Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told NewsChannel 5 Saturday night. She said he was looking forward to starting school at Vatterott College next week.

""They told me how many times my son was shot. Eight,"" said McSpadden. She said he was visiting his grandmother, who lives in the complex, and was returning from the store.

Fifteen police agencies responded to the scene Saturday afternoon as members of the community started gathering.

The officer who shot Brown has been with the Ferguson Police Department for about six years. He is on paid administrative leave. The officer was interviewed Saturday, and will be interviewed more extensively Sunday. Jackson told Belmar the officer will undergo two psychological evaluations if it is determined he can return to active duty.

St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay {tweeted Sunday}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/MayorSlay/status/498520631479005189"">, saying he stands with County Executive Charlie Dooley in his call ""for a full and open inquiry into yesterday's shooting in Ferguson.""

Outside the Ferguson Police Department's headquarters Sunday morning protesters raised their hands in the air and chanted ""Don't shoot."" Those protesters could be heard in the background during the news conference.

On Saturday, witnesses told NewsChannel 5 Brown had raised his hands in the air before he was shot, but that information was not confirmed by Belmar.

The protesters are calling for 10,000 people to join them in protesting at 10 a.m. Monday at the Ferguson Police Department. The crowd marched through the streets Sunday morning and afternoon, calling for justice.

""We are hurt to hear that yet another teenaged boy has been slaughtered by law enforcement especially in light of the recent death of Eric Garner in New York who was killed for selling cigarettes. We plan to do everything within our power to ensure that the Ferguson Police Department as well as the St. Louis County Police Department releases all details pertinent to the shooting. We strongly encourage residents to stay away from the crime scene so that no additional citizens are injured.

Reilly tweeted that police asked him for his ID when he took a photo. He said he and Lowery were arrested for ""not packing their bags quick enough.""

Lowery tweeted, ""Officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door they were asking me to walk out of.""

Los Angeles Times reporter Matt Pearce tweeted that when he contacted Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson and asked about the arrests of the reporters, Jackson responded, ""Oh God.""

Pearce said he spoke to the chief a second time and Jackson said he asked the riot command to release the reporters.

The Post is ""relieved that Wesley is going to be OK"" and ""appalled by the conduct of police officers involved,"" Washington Post editor Martin Baron said. ""That behavior was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news.""

Lowery won the Emerging Journalist of the Year award at the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists this month. NABJ President Bob Butler released a statement Wednesday night regarding the arrests.

""Journalists have a constitutionally protected right to work without the government interference,"" Butler said. ""We call on -- and fully expect -- the authorities to investigate what appears to be a violation of the First Amendment and to hold the officers involved to account, if necessary.""

Ryan Grin, Washington bureau chief of The Huffington Post, released a statement: ""Compared to some others who have come into contact with the police, they came out relatively unscathed, but that in no way excuses the false arrest or the militant aggression toward these journalists.

The shooting happened around 12 p.m. at the Canfield Green apartment complex. Police have not released a reason for the shooting.

Family confirmed the victim was 18-year-old Michael Brown. Officers from 15 other departments responded to the scene after a second round of gunfire rang out.

Dorian Johnson recalled Brown turning and putting his hands in the air before he was shot in the head and chest.

The shooting has angered the predominantly African-American community and sparked three nights of protests. Tensions were increased early Wednesday when police shot and wounded an armed man not far from the site of a community protest meeting.

""Race relations is a top priority right now,"" says Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson. He says the police are working with the Justice Department's community relations experts to help address the racial discord that has erupted into three nights of protests — one of which ended with tear gas.

On previous nights, crowds have gathered to protest Brown's death, sometimes looting stores, setting fire to buildings and vandalizing property. They also taunted police and assaulted journalists. More than three dozen people have been arrested. Brown's family and civil-rights groups have pleaded for the community to stay calm.

Jackson said that protesters Monday night threw rocks at police and that gunfire came from the crowd, so officers used tear gas and shot ""beanbag rounds,"" meant to stun them. A Missouri state senator was among those gassed.

""I just wanted to know if I was going to be gassed again like I was on Monday night,"" Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal said to Jackson at a press conference. ""I was peaceful and I am your state senator.""

Police in Ferguson are asking that protesters stop when the sun goes down, a request met with criticism on social media.

Demonstrators are demanding that the Ferguson Police Department identify the name of the officer who shot Brown.

Police, who had promised to make the officer's name public on Tuesday, cited threats against the officer on social media for the delay.

""An officer's name was released as being the one involved in the shooting. He was not the one involved in the shooting, however there were threats against his life,"" Jackson says. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we weighed the value of releasing the name right now against the safety factor to both him, his family and his neighborhood.""

Authorities have said the officer has been placed on paid administrative leave.

Johnson, Brown's friend and witness to the shooting, was summoned by police and FBI on Wednesday to give his account. He said has moved from his apartment with his girlfriend and young daughter because he fears retaliation from police.

""I left because I feared that if I stayed, something would happen to me. I felt like if they would have gotten me, they would have done anything possible to make sure I couldn't come forth and give my side of what happened,"" Johnson told KSDK.

Johnson said the incident started around 1:40 p.m. Saturday when the officer pulled up beside the pair as they were walking down the street near his grandmother's house.

""He didn't say freeze, halt or anything like we were committing a crime,"" Johnson told KSDK. ""He said, 'Get the 'F' on the sidewalk.'""

He said the officer, whose name has not been released, shoved open the car door, grabbed Brown around the neck and tried to pull him through the window. He said Brown never tried to reach for the officer's weapon.

""The second time he says, 'I'll shoot.' A second later the gun went off and he let go,"" Johnson said. ""That's how we were able to run at the same time.""

Johnson said he ducked behind a car as the officer continued shooting at them, hitting Brown in the back.

""His (Brown's) hands immediately went into the air and he turned around to the officer,"" Johnson recalled. ""My friend started to tell the officer that he was unarmed and that he could stop shooting (him). Before he could get his second sentence out, the officer fired several more shots into his head and chest area. He fell dramatically into the fatal position. I did not hear once he yell freeze, stop or halt. it was just horrible to watch.""

Johnson, who began to sob during the interview, said he could tell Brown was in pain: ""It hurt him a lot. Could see it in his eyes. It was definitely like being shot like an animal.

""I definitely think (the officer) is guilty of murder,"" Johnson said.

Police have said that a scuffle broke out after the officer asked the teens to move. Police have not confirmed witness accounts that Brown had raised his hands to surrender when the shots were fired.

A second witness, who will be interviewed by the FBI, told the St. Louis NAACP that Brown did not struggle with the officer inside his patrol car.

The protests triggered by the shooting have rocked the city, prompting police to fire tear gas during some of the street confrontations.

At one church gathering Tuesday with dozens of clergy members and elected officials, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon urged calm ""in the face of crisis.""

""We stand together tonight, reeling from what feels like an old wound torn open afresh,"" Nixon said. ""A wound that hadn't quite healed right in the first place, and now the pain is just as searing as when the injury first occurred.""

Tensions over the shooting were further heightened Tuesday after authorities backed down on an earlier promise to release the name of the police officer who killed the unarmed Brown. All but three of the police department's 53 officers are white.

The National Bar Association, whose membership is predominantly African-American, filed a records request Wednesday morning demanding the name, gender, rank, race, age and seniority of the officer who shot Brown.

The organization also asked for information about the past conduct of the officer and any information about his or her alleged use of force against any suspects while with the Ferguson Police Department.

""We believe, for the sake of transparency and for the sake of bringing calmness to the community, it is imperative that they release the name,"" said the association's president, Pamela Meanes. ""I think a lot of the frustration and a lot of the disruption is because people don't trust the process.""

Meanes said releasing the name of the officer who killed Brown would help reassure people that the investigation into Brown's death will be fair and independent.

The group is also asking for other information. The requested records include any incident reports, investigative reports, notes and memorandums prepared by officers, in-dash camera video, photographs, cellphone video and recordings, and the names and seniority of the officer or officers involved in the Aug. 9 shooting

Meanes said if the officer's name isn't disclosed by Monday, her group would ask a county judge to order police to release it.

USAToday,usa6,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/,Chief: Officer noticed Brown carrying suspected stolen cigars,Yamiche Alcindor; Marisol Bello; Aamer Madhani,08/15/2014,11/02/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Michael Brown was identified as a suspect in a strong-arm robbery of a box of cigars moments before he was shot to death by Officer Darren Wilson, police said Friday.

In an afternoon press conference, Ferguson, Mo. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson did not initially make a connection between the robbery and Brown,whose death spurred violent protests and unrest in the St. Louis suburb over the past week.

Wilson stopped Brown and a friend because ""they were in the middle of the street, blocking traffic,"" Jackson said.

Hours later, however, Jackson told a slightly different story to CNN and NBC, saying that Wilson noticed Brown was carrying a box of cigars that had been reported stolen. Wilson, he said, initially stopped Brown for blocking traffic, but as he began driving past Brown, he noticed Brown was holding cigars.

At that point, Wilson ""made the connection"" that Brown might have been involved in a theft that had just been broadcast on police radio, Jackson said.

Jackson earlier released Wilson's name along with information that Brown was a suspect in the previous robbery. He said he released surveillance video tape and documents related to the robbery to satisfy freedom of information requests from the public.

His decision to release both bits of information at the same time has come under fire by residents and Brown supporters who said the police were trying to divert attention away from Wilson and justify the shooting by blaming Brown.

Jackson would not say why he released the information when he did the way he did, other than to say he was responding to freedom of information requests from the public about the robbery.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown's family, told USA TODAY the release of the officer's name alongside a robbery report naming Brown as a suspect ""smoke and mirrors.""

""There was nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that would justify this execution style murder by this police officer in broad daylight,"" Crump said. ""It's not enough that they assassinated him in broad daylight in the middle of the street. They also have to assassinate his character to try to get away with it.""

He said police were trying to divert the public's attention from the crux of the issue. He added that police only releasing photos of the robbery suspect and not Wilson shows that the department will not be transparent.

He said Brown's family believes the police strategically waited to release the officer's name to justify the fatal shooting.

[tweetbegin 500334365919170560 tweetend]

Residents were angry.

""So then why did they shoot him?"" said Keith Miller, 58. ""The way they're putting this out, no one trusts the Ferguson cops. Things are going to stay calm for now. But people aren't going to be patient on this. If they don't charge this cop, it's going to start right back up.""

Jackson gave few details about Wilson, 28. He said Wilson has been a police officer for six years, four years in Ferguson and before that two years in nearby Jennings. Jackson said Wilson has had no disciplinary action against him.

""He's a a gentle quiet man,"" Jackson said in describing the officer. ""He's a distinguished officer.""

He said Wilson has been ""devastated"" by the shooting and its aftermath. ""He never intended for any of this to happen,"" Jackson said.

Earlier in the day, Jackson had given barebones details about a strong-arm robbery at a local convenience store that took place moments before Wilson shot Brown, but he did not explain at the time that the shooting was not connected to the robbery.

Police documents he released to reporters identified Brown as the suspect.

A police offense incident report dated Aug. 9 that was part of the packet of documents Jackson released quotes the officer writing, ""I was able to confirm that Brown is the primary suspect in this incident.""

The report does not name the officer or contain an officer's signature. It also does not contain the address where the robbery is said to have happened.

But it provides the following description of the robbery: An employee at a Ferguson convenience store saw Brown grab a box of Swisher Sweet cigars and hand them to another young man identified as Dorian Johnson, who was standing behind him. The employee said he told Brown he had to pay for the cigars and instead, Brown reached across the counter and grabbed numerous packets of cigars and turned to leave the store.

The report says according to the employee Brown grabbed his shirt and pushed him into a display rack. Then he and Johnson left the store without paying. Jackson said Johnson would not be charged with a crime.

The report describes Brown as 6'4, 292 pounds and wearing a white T-shirt, khaki long shorts, yellow socks and a red Cardinals baseball cap.

During a press conference in the afternoon, Jackson said he had to release the video tape because of several freedom of information requests.

Brown was unarmed when Wilson killed him. Witnesses in the area say Brown had raised his hands to surrender when he was shot. Police have not confirmed that information.

No one answered at Wilson's door in his home in suburban Crestwood, Mo. A police officer keeping an eye on the house said Wilson and his family left days ago.

A neighbor, who did not want to be identified, said that Wilson had moved into the neighborhood less than a year ago. She described him as "" tall and slim"" and that she would see him walking his dog in the neighborhood of mostly single-story brick homes. She said she didn't know he was the cop until this morning when Crestwood police informed residents that he was involved and the neighborhood would be getting attention.

Another neighbor, Ron Gorski, said he hopes Wilson gets a fair break.

""He's a young guy,"" Gorski said of Wilson. ""Things happen and it's a complicated situation. I feel for the family and the entire country.""

[tweetbegin 500334365919170560 tweetend]

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson and Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon were not notified or consulted before Darren Wilson's name was released along with information that Brown was a suspect in a robbery.

""I would have liked to have been consulted,"" Johnson said at a press conference Friday.

He added that he hoped to talk to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson about the manner in which the information was released.

Nixon, meanwhile, said that police are still focused on learning details about Brown's death and that nothing should deter them from that goal.

""I think the focal point here remains to figure out how and why Michael Brown was killed and to get justice,"" he said.

The announcement comes after Twitter suspended an account Thursday linked to a loose-knit ""hacktivist"" group that released the name of a police officer it said shot and killed Brown on Saturday night. However, police, Ferguson's mayor and the stepmother of the man named all said the group was incorrect and that the person named is not a police officer.

As of early Friday morning, no violent clashes were reported after hundreds of protesters gathered and marched near the flashpoint where riots and civil unrest have unfolded here in recent days.

USAToday,usa7,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/18/ferguson-national-guard-michael-brown-jay-nixon/14219621/,Chaos erupts again in Ferguson,Larry Copeland; Charisse Jones ,08/19/2014,11/03/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. — With a controversial curfew lifted and the National Guard mobilized, protests started peacefully Monday but as the evening wore on clashes with police escalated until the now sadly familiar scene of tear gas being fired at protesters began.

A standoff between police and demonstrators in this city that has been wracked by grief and rage over the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black teenager began after members of the crowd became confrontational and bottles were thrown at police officers.

Police began to lob tear gas canisters and stun grenades toward protesters who had ignored warnings to clear the street and disperse.

Police said a Molotov cocktail was hurled at officers and a civilian in a car near the scene of the confrontation was shot, CNN reported.

Bishop Edwin Bass of the Church of God in Christ, who was on the scene urging people to remain calm, said, ""The crowd shifts substantially about 8 p.m. A lot of the family people, and people here for legitimate protest reasons, leave. The people who are here for mayhem, confusion and chaos come out.""

That pattern appeared be playing out Monday night, as Capt. Ron Johnson, regional head of the Missouri State Highway patrol, said numerous arrests had been made.

Hundreds of protesters approached a line of police and many shouted while face-to-face with the officers. Amid the tense situation, a group of people trying to keep the peace locked arms and managed to position themselves between the more confrontational protesters and the police line.

The crowd was ordered to disperse by officers in armored trucks that appeared on the scene, but the protesters continued to march down the street.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Monday dropped the curfew that had been in effect for two nights in an ill-fated effort to curb the violence and chaos that have ripped this city since Michael Brown, 18, an unarmed black pedestrian, was shot to death by white police officer Darren Wilson, 28, on Aug. 9,

Nixon announced that the National Guard would assume ""limited responsibilities"" to help keep order during nighttime protests over the shooting.

""With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence, and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard,"" Nixon said in a written statement. ""We will not use a curfew tonight.""

A grand jury may begin hearing the case on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. It was unclear how long it might take for a decision on whether Wilson should face criminal charges for Brown's death.

Meanwhile, President Obama announced that Attorney General Eric Holder will go to Ferguson on Wednesday to meet with local leaders as well as FBI and Justice officials who are conducting an independent federal civil rights investigation into the shooting.

At a late afternoon news conference, Obama once again called for understanding and calm on Ferguson's streets.

""While I understand the passion and anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving in to that anger by looting ... only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos,'' he said, adding, ""There's no excuse for excessive force by police or any action that denies people the right to protest peacefully.""

But there continued to be clashes between law enforcement officials and those gathered on Ferguson's streets.

Scott Olson, a news photographer with Getty Images, became the latest journalist to be arrested, according to Pancho Bernasconi, Getty's vice president for news. Olson's arrest was captured by one of his Getty colleagues, Joe Raedle. He was later released, and in a statement, Getty said he would continue working in Ferguson.

Others had their own tense encounters with the police. In one instance during the afternoon, St. Louis County police officers arrested a man walking on the sidewalk.

Capt. Johnson said one man who was arrested for failure to disperse had threatened to hurt police officers.

""That's not not freedom of speech when you say I'm going to hurt you,"" Johnson said. ""That's not freedom of speech.""

Two police officers tackled the man and took him to the ground while onlookers shouted that the man wasn't doing anything wrong.

""I didn't see anybody behaving in any way that would instigate for the police to do anything,"" said Ben Mengis, 55, of St. Louis County, who said he was standing 10 feet from the incident. ""He did not do anything.""

A police spokesman could not be reached for comment.

At 5:15 p.m. local time, as CNN's Don Lemon did a live report on the sidewalk on West Florissant Avenue, St. Louis County police pushed him and a group of protesters surrounding him backward on the sidewalk.

A minute or two later, one of the protest leaders led a large group of protesters to a parking lot on the other side of the street.

When small groups of protesters gathered, police ordered them away from some of the spots that have been prone to late-night upheaval. As evening approached, the police presence in the area near West Florissant Avenue and Ferguson Avenue was increasing sharply, with officers from the Missouri State Highway Patrol, St. Louis County police and St Louis Metropolitan police.

Around 5:50 p.m. local time, an official in a police vehicle drove along West Florissant telling people via loudspeaker that they had to keep moving if they were on the sidewalk. If they stood still, he said, they would be given one warning and then would be arrested.

Capt. Johnson said he planned to prevent a repeat of the violence that erupted the previous night. ""We have an operational plan to address that and we're going to put it in place,"" he said. ""Our city cannot afford another night (like) last night. We can't.""

He said the rule requiring that protesters on the sidewalk keep moving was meant to prevent troublemakers from infiltrating groups of legitimate demonstrators.

""They have to keep walking,"" Johnson said. ""We're not going to let groups congregate and build into larger groups. That's what causes the problem.""

He said that people's' Constitutional right to peaceful assembly was not being violated.

With the National Guard in Ferguson, Obama said that in a conversation with the governor, he ""expressed an interest in making sure that ... the National Guard is used in a limited and appropriate way.''

""I'll be watching over the next several days to see whether in fact it's helping rather hindering'' progress, the president said.

Outrage over Brown's shooting spurred protests in this predominantly black city of 21,000 on the outskirts of St. Louis. When demonstrators met with a heavy police presence, fierce nightly clashes erupted.

The midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew that was lifted Monday did little to curb the violence and looting. A representative of the Nation of Islam said his group would ask protesters to go home early Monday night. He noted that the group can't force people to leave but cited ""the militarized police force"" and the National Guard as reasons to do so.

""We are going to tell them that this is a different day now with the National Guard in,"" said Akbar Muhammad, international representative of the Nation of Islam. ""We want them to leave by sunset.""

Muhammad also said at a press conference near the Ferguson Police Department that his group is looking for a venue to hold a youth rally, ""like a town hall meeting"" for local youths.

""We want to let them speak, express themselves,"" he said.

The latest unrest led officials to close all schools in the Ferguson-Florissant School District on Monday. School had already been postponed last week due to the violence.

Nixon ordered the National Guard into Ferguson hours after police cited ""preplanned"" acts of aggression by protesters Sunday night and early Monday morning. Protesters shot at police, threw Molotov cocktails at officers, looted businesses and carried out a ""coordinated attempt"" to block roads and overrun the police's command center, the governor's office said in a written statement.

""We are all frustrated and looking for justice to be achieved regarding the shooting death of Michael Brown,"" Nixon's statement said. ""As the dual investigations continue into what happened nine days ago at Canfield Green, we must defend Ferguson from these violent interlopers so that the peaceful protests can operate in peace and the search for answers and justice can continue.""

Earlier Monday, lawyers for Brown's family released details of the private autopsy done at the request of the family by pathologist Michael Baden. The preliminary report indicated Brown was shot six times. Only one of the shots was fatal, Baden said.

""It verifies the worst that the family thinks happened — that he was executed,"" family attorney Benjamin Crump said. ""It confirms what the witnesses said, that this was an execution.""

Officer Wilson has supporters. More than 100 people rallied Sunday in downtown St. Louis on his behalf. The rally was organized through social media and the {Support Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""https://www.facebook.com/I-Support-Officer-Wilson-276961059165311/""> Facebook page, which was created Saturday. By noon Monday, the page had drawn more than 24,000 ""likes.""

More than two hours before a second midnight curfew was set to begin Sunday night, police fired tear gas at hundreds of angry protesters who were marching down the town's main thoroughfare toward a police command center.

""Based on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of our response,"" said the highway patrol's Johnson. ""We had to act to protect lives and property.""

At least two people were injured, including one who was shot, Johnson said. Seven or eight people were arrested and will be charged with failure to disperse, police said.

""Police were shot at, makeshift barricades were set up to block police, bottles and rocks were thrown at police,"" Johnson said.

Some protesters said no one threw Molotov cocktails.

Renita Lamkin, 43, the pastor of St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church in St. Charles, Mo., has been acting as a peacekeeper, urging people to remain calm.

""That is not true,"" she said when asked about claims that protesters threw Molotov cocktails.",515,17915,NA,"also repeat pictures, bc gallery is from #1"

Reporters Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post said on Twitter that police told them to stop recording the chaos, then took them into custody.

Brown, a black teenager, died Saturday after being shot by a police officer. The 18-year-old was unarmed.

African Americans are two-thirds of the population of this St. Louis suburb, but they account for nine out of 10 stops by police. The 53-member police force includes three African Americans.

That disparity has led to long-simmering tensions that flared when a police officer, still unidentified, fatally shot Brown, who was walking to his grandmother's home Saturday afternoon with a friend.

Throughout the city on Wednesday, dozens of officers set up barricades, blocking most main roads. As the sun set, the loud flash of grenades and the whir of helicopters filled the area. Tear gas was dispersed, so much that the stinging air lingered for hours.

Members of the crowd hurled Molotov cocktails and other objects at police, according to the Associated Press.

Police yelled ""Hold the line"" and ""Stop your vehicle."" As three vehicles approached a QuickTrip store that had burned on Sunday night, officers in bulletproof vests drew and pointed rifles at the cars.

The sound of apparent gunshots was heard nearby and police officers began to back away from protesters who approached them with their hands raised.

One officer told a reporter trying to get a live shot, ""Get down! It will look bad if you get shot.""

Late Wednesday night, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon announced via Twitter that he had canceled his scheduled Thursday appearances at the Missouri State Fair to go to St. Louis County.

Earlier Wednesday, after four days of angry calls for reform and tear gas lobbed at protesters, the city's police chief that healing racial discord here has become a ""top priority"" and he welcomes outside help.

""Race relations is a top priority right now,"" Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said. ""I've been trying to increase the diversity of the department since I got here.""

Protests outside police department

A crowd of about 100 people gathered outside the Ferguson Police Station at midnight. Protesters screamed now-familiar chants of those moved by the death of Brown: ""No justice, no peace,"" ""What if this was your child?"" and ""Hands up, don't shoot.""

Added to those were: ""Hey, hey. Hey, ho. These killer cops have got to go.""

The scene, without tear gas and police in riot gear, was much calmer than earlier demonstrations. People mainly stood around holding signs while a group played the drums outside a Ferguson Fire Station across the street

Antonio French

Alderman French, a popular politician in the 21st Ward who has organized summer jazz concerts, had been tweeting, posting Vines, and talking to national media about the protests and increasingly heavy police response.

His wife, who uses the twitter handle {@senka}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/senka"">, tweeted Wednesday evening that ""@antonioFrench is in Ferguson jail,"" and that he had been arrested. She updated to say the charges were for unlawful custody and that he'd be held for 24 hours.

Benac French, whose Twitter account is followed by President Barack Obama, directed those tweets at politicians including U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill and Gov. Nixon. She later said others who had been protesting outside the police department were arrested, including community activists.

City asks for daylight protests

City officials issued a statement Wednesday expressing sympathy for the Brown family and asking people to confine their demonstrations to daylight hours to maintain calm. That didn't happen.

Jackson has said the officer was assaulted by Brown and that the officer was pushed into his squad car, where a scuffle over his gun resulted in a gunshot. They emerged from the car and the officer fired several shots. Brown lay dead.

His friend, Dorian Johnson, tells a sharply different story.

Johnson, 22, told KSDK-TV that a white officer shot Brown ""like an animal"" in the head and chest as the teen put his hands in the air.

Johnson said the incident started around 1:40 p.m. Saturday when the officer pulled up beside the pair as they were walking down the street.

""He didn't say freeze, halt or anything like we were committing a crime,"" Johnson told KSDK. ""He said, 'Get the 'F' on the sidewalk.'""

The officer then shoved open the car door, grabbed Brown around the neck and was pulling him through the window, Johnson said.

""The second time he says, 'I'll shoot.' A second later, the gun went off and he let go,"" Johnson said. ""That's how we were able to run at the same time.""

Johnson said he ducked behind a car as the officer continued shooting at them, hitting Brown in the back.

""His (Brown's) hands immediately went into the air and he turned around to the officer,"" Johnson recalled. ""My friend started to tell the officer that he was unarmed and that he could stop shooting (him). Before he could get his second sentence out, the officer fired several more shots into his head and chest area.""

He added: ""It was definitely like being shot like an animal. ... I definitely think (the officer) is guilty of murder.""

Anthony Gray, a lawyer for Michael Brown's family, said the teen's body was turned over to the family Wednesday afternoon. He said the family was hiring someone to perform a second autopsy.

Jackson said his department is working with the Justice Department's community relations experts to address the community's racial strife. He said he hoped to arrange a meeting with Brown's relatives as early as Thursday.

Legal association files for officer's name

Police refused again on Wednesday to identify the officer or his race, citing threats that have been made against the police force.

The National Bar Association, whose membership is predominantly African-American, filed a records request Wednesday demanding the name, gender, rank, race, age and seniority of the officer. The organization also asked for information about the past conduct of the officer and any information about his or her use or alleged use of force against any suspects while with the Ferguson Police Department.

""We believe for the sake of transparency and for the sake of bringing calmness to the community, it is imperative that they release the name,"" said the association's president, Pamela Meanes. ""I think a lot of the frustration and a lot of the disruption is because people don't trust the process.""

Meanes said if the officer's name isn't disclosed by Monday, her group would ask a county judge to order police to release it.

Segregation legacy

St. Louis city and county are among the most segregated areas in the country.

Priscilla Dowden-White, a history professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said the anger, rioting and violence that have shaken Ferguson are a legacy of the racial segregation of the region.

""This is rooted in how the St. Louis community developed racially,"" she said. ""This was a situation that was bound to occur.""

St. Louis was at the epicenter of the fight against housing discrimination against blacks. In 1916, the city passed an ordinance that prohibited blacks from buying homes in or moving to predominantly white communities. The law was struck down in 1917.

But racially restricted covenants, which prohibited homeowners from selling a house to blacks, remained in effect until 1948, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the legally binding agreements after hearing the case of a black homebuyer in St. Louis.

Dowden-White said what followed was a migration of blacks to the northern suburbs of St. Louis County, including Ferguson. Still, real estate agents steered African Americans in certain directions.

""African Americans were relegated to certain communities,"" said Dowden-White.

That segregation, coupled with high unemployment, no wealth, low homeownership and few quality schools, resulted in communities steeped in poverty, she said.

""What we are seeing is the impact of poverty,"" she said. ""And the legacy of poverty breeds a volatile situation. … We are seeing the response of people who are angry and cannot see a way out.""

Stop and search

Terrell Marshall, 24, of Ferguson, said he has experienced what those numbers mean firsthand. In July, he said, he was walking home through Canfield Green Apartments, where Brown was shot, when police officers stopped him. The officers grabbed his luggage, emptied his belongings onto the ground and searched him, he said. He said he went along with the treatment he has seen others in his neighborhood endure.

""The police have been harassing people for a long time,"" he said. ""The shooting shed some light on this, but there is still stuff out there.""",181,4380,NA,same gallery from USA1 AND embedded tweets

Citizens protesting the death of black Missouri teenager Michael Brown appeared to be getting along peacefully as they marched alongside state troopers, who took over operational control of the protest scenes Thursday.

Several marchers stopped to shake hands with police and troopers. Some people stopped to hug and chat with Capt. Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol, who was born and grew up near this community and is now overseeing security.

The scene stood in stark contrast clashes earlier this week when officers wore riot gear.

Gov. Jay Nixon announced Thursday that the Missouri Highway Patrol would be taking control of security in Ferguson and that the unit in the embattled town would be overseen by Johnson.

""What's gone on here over the last few days is not what Missouri is about. It's not what Ferguson is about. This is a place where people work, go to school, raise their families, go to church,"" Nixon said. ""But lately it's looked a little bit more like a war zone and that's unacceptable.""

Johnson said people need to show respect to each other.

""It means a lot to me personally that we this break cycle of violence, heal tension and build trust,"" Johnson said.

He sidestepped questions about whether he thought St. Louis County and Ferguson police were at fault for the days of unrest. But he promised that residents would see a change in approach.

Johnson walked to the QuikTrip convenience store — ground zero of the protests — to meet with protesters. And he said he ordered police to remove gas masks from their kits before they headed out to the streets for a fifth night of protests.

""We are going to move forward from today and I would ask if we're going to critique, critique me from today,"" Johnson said.

St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson walked among demonstrators shaking hands, posing for selfies and cheerfully explaining to people that he understood their need to vent. He said his department brought about six of its 1,300 police officers to support the Missouri Highway Patrol.

""There is a sense of change,"" Dotson said. ""This is what communities do. What I see are people expressing their First Amendment rights. I only ask that everybody obey the law.""

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said he supports freedom of assembly, but not disobedience for the law.

""I am for justice,"" Dooley said. ""I am not for revenge.""

Late Thursday, the National Action Network headed by civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton, announced a Unity Rally for Justice for Michael Brown will be held in Ferguson at the Greater Grace Church at 3 p.m. Sunday. According to the organization's website, the Brown family will participate, as will Martin Luther King III.

Obama: 'Emotions are raw'

President Obama called for peace and calm in Ferguson, after meeting with Attorney General Eric Holder about repeated clashes between police and protesters after the shooting death of Brown, who was unarmed, on Saturday.

""I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,"" Obama said from his vacation in Edgartown, Mass.

""But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law; a basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protes.""

Holder said after meeting with Obama that he was ""deeply concerned"" about the deployment of military equipment and vehicles in Ferguson. The Justice Department is investigating the death of Brown, which sparked the protests, for possible violations of state law or civil rights.

Holder said trust must be rebuilt between law enforcement and the community, and he was offering assistance through the COPS office and the Office of Justice Programs to help crowd control and maintain public safety

""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" Holder said. The technical assistance from Justice is aimed at maintaining public safety ""without relying on unnecessarily extreme displays of force.""

Darryl Parks, an attorney for Michael Brown's family, said Brown's mother met with two attorneys from the U.S. Department Justice's Civil Rights Division and two prosecutors from the office of the U.S. Attorney Eastern District of Missouri.

The 1:30 p.m. meeting lasted about an hour with the officials not going into details about their work but ensuring a fair and through investigation into Brown's death and possible civil rights violations.

""This family feels far better today about the investigation that is taking place,"" Parks said.

""It gives them real assurance that a proper investigation is taking place and that as the truth comes out the responsible person will be held accountable for what he did to Michael Brown,"" Parks said. ""They have a lot more confidence and trust in what the feds are going to do compared to what the state was doing.""

The federal officials didn't provide any specifics about their investigative plans or what they have already learned. The DOJ has already talked to some witnesses but did note give Lesley McSpadden, Brown's mother, a timeline for when they might conclude.

Parks said Brown's family will likely meet with the officials again as the investigation continues.

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said she thought the police response had become part of the problem. ""The police response needs to be demilitarized.""

Investigation into Brown

KSDK-TV reported that the FBI will take over a large part of the investigation. The St. Louis County Police Department has been in charge of the investigation into the unarmed black teenager's death and with securing the streets of the city during the confrontations between protesters and law enforcement.

It was not immediately clear how removing the county police force would affect the Ferguson Police Department, which is a separate law enforcement entity. It was a Ferguson police officer who was involved in the fatal shooting of Brown that has angered the largely African-American community of around 20,000 people.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson echoed the view that the police would change how they interact with protesters.



""We are going to try to facilitate the protests tonight and we hope the protesters will recognize that we are trying to help everybody bring the tension down,"" he said at a news conference Thursday.

""It's a powder keg, and we all recognize that,"" he said. ""What's happening now is not what anyone of us want... We need to get everyone to calm down.""

But he also said that the police was prepared to respond forcefully to violence. ""We have to respond to deadly force,"" he said. ""We certainly don't want to have any violence on our part.""

At a meeting of St . Louis area clergy on Thursday, residents and pastors complained that the environment has become similar to a war zone.

Resident: 'Every night we're tormented'

""We should not be looking like Iraq, Beirut, Israel, the Gaza Strip,"" said Rev. Robert Scott of the Central Baptist Church in St. Louis.

Residents said the city in recent days had been marked by burning trash cans and police officers blocking mothers from getting out of their neighborhoods so they can buy formula.

Sierra Smith, who lives in apartment complex that has been at the center of the protests, complained to the governor that her neighborhood has been under police siege since Brown's death.

""Every night we're tormented,"" she said. ""The police have no respect at all for the community.""

Riot gear

The St. Louis County police, outfitted with riot gear and heavy armaments, have been the most visible force in the clashes with demonstrators. That effort has been marked by the use of tear gas and stun grenades.

Sixteen people were arrested and two police officers were injured during the latest round of unrest. One of the officers suffered an ankle injury after being hit by a brick. The other officer's injury is unclear, according to KSDK.

Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who has been posting Vine videos and tweeting about the protests, {was released Thursday morning}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/14/antonio-french-ferguson-arrest-released-police/14064687/""> after being detained overnight on accusations of unlawful assembly.

The evening clashes were marked by the whir of police helicopters and the bang of flash grenades, along with the smell of tear gas that hung in the air for hours.

As the unrest gripped the community, Ferguson schools pushed back the first day of classes from Thursday to Monday.

Protesters have demanded that police release the name of the officer involved.

After initially promising to make the name public, police backed off because of what they said were threats from social media.

In the latest twist in the saga, what they said was the name of the officer. Reporters who followed up on the tip said the tip was false. Later, the Anonymous account on Twitter was suspended.

Ferguson Police Chief Jackson tried on Wednesday to address racial disparity in the police department in this St. Louis suburb where two-thirds of the population of 20,000 are African American and account for nine out of 10 stops by police. The 53-member police force includes three African Americans.

""Race relations is a top priority right now,"" Jackson said. ""I've been trying to increase the diversity of the department since I got here.""

On Wednesday evening, as three vehicles approached a QuikTrip store that was burned on Sunday night, officers in bulletproof vests drew and pointed rifles at the cars.

The sound of apparent gunshots was heard nearby and officers began to pull back from protesters who approached them with their hands raised, mimicking what witnesses said Brown was doing when he was fatally shot in the head and chest.

Reverend Derrick Robinson was one of the organizers.

""We want answers, we want justice in our community, we want diversity,"" Robinson said.

In the wake of last weekend's fatal police shooting of 18-year old Michael Brown, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles was asked about the diversity of his police department: 53 officers, just three of them African-American in a community that's 67 percent African-American, according to 2010 Census data.

The mayor says it's difficult to hire black officers.

""We hire everyone that we can get,"" Knowles said. ""There's also the problem that a lot of young African American people don't want to go into law enforcement. They already have this disconnect with law enforcement, so if we find people who want to go into law enforcement who are African American we're all over it because we want them to help us bridge the gap. But these young people, they're not interested in law enforcement. There's already this frustration with law enforcement.""

Ferguson resident Nicole Chissem who is African American was asked if she'd like to see more black police officers in her hometown.

""Of course, most definitely, I think it would help the morale.""

A different response from Terrance Dodd, also a black resident of Ferguson.

""It don't make a difference what color they are,"" Dodd said, ""it's not about race or none of that. We just need good police officers.""

""Race should not make a difference,"" said Tim Maher, a criminology professor with the University of Missouri. ""With that said, I think cities and departments should make every attempt to reflect the population of the police department with the population of the community to the best of their ability.""

The 2013 racial profiling statistics provided by the state of Missouri show a disproportionate number of stops, searches and arrests of blacks. Of 5,384 police stops in Ferguson, 686 were white citizens, 4,632 were black citizens. Of 611 searches, 47 were white, 562 were black. Of 521 arrests in Ferguson in 2013, 36 were white, 483 were black.

Maher, who was a police officer for 13 years before becoming a criminologist, says data that could indicate racial profiling has to be explained fully to the public.

""The police chief and his officers should be aware of that data and should in some way be able to reasonably describe why the data exists that way, and justify if there's a disproportionate number of one race over another being stopped in that jurisdiction,"" said Maher.

Maher says the ethnicity of people who live in nearby communities and drive through Ferguson, could account for some of the numbers, but not all of them.

""If it's a community surrounded by a group of other communities that have a higher proportion of the race that is being stopped than what live in their community, that can help justify it,"" said Maher, ""but it also could mean they are racially profiling and targeting the particular group that's being stopped more often.""

Rev. Robinson plans to continue holding Ferguson officials accountable.

""I think if it's going to change and get better there has to be a diversity.""",8,362,NA,NA

They snapped a photo. They used a hashtag. And, in the span of five days, their growing, stinging social media cloud of real-time updates shaped a raw public discourse about the teen, Michael Brown, race relations and police force in the USA.

""Because of social media, the police don't have control of this story,"" said {David Karpf}<hyperlink=""http://smpa.gwu.edu/david-karpf"">, assistant professor of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University.

""It's opened everything up, changed how the media decides what's worthy of coverage — and who to trust,"" Karpf said.

Ferguson has been mentioned in 6 million tweets since Saturday, when Brown was shot, according to an e-mail from a Twitter spokesperson.

Several hashtags have emerged during the protests. {#IfTheyGunnedMeDown}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/12/if-they-gunned-me-down-hashtag-twitter/13982539/""> confronts the portrayal of young minorities by media outlets. #Dontshoot raises concerns about {excessive police force}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/13/ferguson-protests-hands-up/14010683/""> while demonstrating peaceful protest.

What's happening in Ferguson is ""eerily familiar"" to protests in Egypt, Turkey and Ukraine, said {Zeynep Tufekci}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/zeynep"">, assistant professor at the University of North Carolina, who teaches about the social impacts of technology.

""You see a livestream by a couple of scrappy citizens, regular media getting arrested, over-policing ... then national media and international media waking up to it,"" Tufekci said. ""It's just unfolded the same way.""

A particular kind of story resonates on social media, one that aligns with the events unfolding in Ferguson, said {Scott Talan}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/talan"">, assistant professor at American University's School of Communication.

Ferguson taps into strong emotions and the familiarity of this narrative.

""When something people view generally as wrong, bad, immoral or unethical happens again and again, people won't say, 'We've seen it before.' At least on social media, people will say, 'Why is this happening again?"" Talan said, citing the #Neveragain hashtag in response to school shootings.

But social media have changed not only what gets noticed, but also who gets noticed. In this case, it's the residents of Ferguson who are taking the spotlight.

""Usually in an activist campaign like this, there would be a trusted leader speaking out for the cause. We don't see that with Ferguson, and that's a positive in this case. We see a community standing up for itself,"" Karpf said.

A local official, St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, had been documenting the protests and police reaction through Vine, a micro-video social media site, and tweeting his vines out with the hashtag #Ferguson. He was {arrested Wednesday}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/antonio-french-alderman-arrest-ferguson-missouri/14042391/""> and spent the night in jail.

""After a night in the #Ferguson jail, I'm free. My staffers who were also arrested last night are also free. Thank you for all the support,"" French tweeted Thursday. It has been re-tweeted more than 4,000 times.

Social media can be an effective form of activism, but experts also express concern over the validity of information disseminated so quickly and freely.

On Thursday, hacker activist group Anonymous released a name supposedly of the officer who shot Brown, but it turned out to be wrong. It was someone who is not on the Ferguson police force. A relative at his home expressed fear over what someone getting the false information might do.

Twitter suspended the Anonymous account.

""The nature and speed of the Internet can cause people to jump to conclusions and rush ahead, but it's also self-correcting,"" Talan said.

When protests in Ferguson began, Tufekci recalls online conversations questioning whether the situation would make the news.

""Somebody said, 'Yes, because we have Twitter',"" she said.",63,1519,NA,NA
USAToday,usa13,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/16/michael-brown-shooting-ferguson-missouri-police/14152447/,"Looting, tear gas shatter period of calm in Ferguson",Yamiche Alcindor,08/19/2014,11/09/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Armored vehicles, riot gear, tear gas and looting returned to this small Midwest city early Saturday as a brief period of peaceful demonstrations gave way to a violent atmosphere of anarchy.

The intense night shattered a short-lived calm that had been hailed as a turning point after a week of protests following the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, a black unarmed 18-year-old killed by a police officer.

During the night, buildings burned, windows shattered, and chaos ensued as protesters stood in the street criticizing police. Officers threatened to arrest protesters who came near their trucks. Yet authorities did not attempt to stop any looting as citizens moved to protect local businesses from sporadic thefts.

""We didn't have any supervision so people got super out of hand,"" said Derrick Robinson, 30, of Ferguson. ""I was very disappointed and upset about what was going on.""

Friday evening's protests were calm, though boisterous. People played drums and sang songs in memory of Brown at QuikTrip, where protesters have gathered for the last week. However, around midnight Saturday, protesters began clashing with police officers as cops in armored vehicles lined up on West Florissant Avenue, a main city thoroughfare.

As the mood intensified, officers threw tear gas into the crowd and then quickly retreated. But some 30 minutes later, the officers returned to a position on the street that they would occupy for the next four to five hours.

On Friday, officials released the name of the officer who killed Brown — Darren Wilson — as well as information that Brown was a suspect in a robbery. The move — to name Brown's killer while also releasing information about a possible criminal act by the teen — angered many protesters who repeatedly said they thought police were trying to paint Brown as a criminal deserving of death.

Anthony Shahid, one of the most visible activists who has been protesting in Ferguson, said he sensed things would escalate as soon as he learned about the information police released.

""They (Ferguson Police) gave a press conference and one of the first things they did was read about this man's history,"" he said. ""It inflamed this community. All you heard people say was that they didn't like that. I think it's very disrespectful, insensitive and callous.""

In a now-familiar scene in Ferguson, police officers Saturday morning held rifles and yelled at protesters to get out of the street or risk being arrested. Despite this, some in the crowd walked toward police officers with their hands in the air. Eventually other protesters convinced people walking toward the officers to move back.

It was then, as people walked back, that some began breaking into nearby stores. At a nearby Beauty Supply Store, people stole bags of fake hair, while across the street at Ferguson Market and Liquor others carried out large bottles of alcohol.

Ferguson Market and Liquor is the store that Ferguson police say Brown is suspected of robbing shortly before his death. On Saturday morning, looters smashed its front door and ransacked its shelves.

The chaos caught Robinson off guard. The Ferguson resident said he had been protesting since 9 a.m. Friday and left the demonstration area at about midnight Saturday.

""I got call at about 1:30 a.m. saying they are looting and breaking into people's stores and that the goal is to burn down Ferguson Market,"" Robinson said. ""I immediately came back to really see what was happening. I was very disappointed and upset about what was going on.""

Robinson's disappointment motivated him to help fend off looters from vulnerable stores. Others like him pleaded with looters to stop taking merchandise while police silently watched.

Christopher Scott, 24, of Northwoods, Mo., stood in front of Ferguson Market and Liquor, blocking the door's shattered front glass door and sharing his feelings with looters. He, along with about 10 other men, physically pushed back a crowd of young men who were trying to make their way into the convenience store.

""I just told them that they need to think,"" Scott said. ""We are smarter than that. I told them that we live here, we sleep here, we eat in our community so it doesn't make sense for us to turn on our community.""

He added: ""I don't want the message sent that everyone out here is just looting, robbing and stealing. That's not the case. A lot of us want justice. A lot of us want peace. A lot of us want a well-regulated community. It's not right for us to tear down our own community. If anything we need to be building it up.""

Amid the chaos, a stark distinction emerged between protesters who blocked people from breaking into stores and looters who hastily carried items away. Despite the residents who acted as peacekeepers, Ferguson eventually became the scene of multiple robberies as people went from store to store carrying out stolen goods.

DaVhaun Coleman, 21, of Florissant, Mo., held a canister of tear gas in his hand as he explained that he was angry police were trying to paint Brown as a criminal. He added that he thought police Saturday used tear gas on the crowd unnecessarily.

""They want to get hands-on,"" Coleman said of police. ""They are just doing what they were trained to do.""

Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson said some in the crowd began throwing rocks and other objects at police, but no arrests were made. One officer was hurt, but information on his injuries was not immediately available. No protesters were hurt.

Brown's family had urged protesters to remain nonviolent hours before chaos broke out again.

In a Friday afternoon press conference, Ferguson, Mo. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson did not initially make a connection between the robbery and Brown. Wilson stopped Brown and a friend because ""they were in the middle of the street, blocking traffic,"" Jackson said.

Hours later, however, Jackson told a slightly different story to CNN and NBC, saying that Wilson noticed Brown was carrying a box of cigars that had been reported stolen. Wilson, he said, initially stopped Brown for blocking traffic, but as he began driving past Brown, he noticed Brown was holding cigars.

At that point, Wilson ""made the connection"" that Brown might have been involved in a theft that had just been broadcast on police radio, Jackson said.

Jackson would not say why he released the information when he did the way he did, other than to say he was responding to freedom of information requests from the public about the robbery.",460,9257,NA,starts from pic#4

The riots and violence have highlighted the small police department in the St. Louis suburb of about 20,000.

Here's a look at Ferguson's police department:

1. The demographics of the Ferguson police do not represent the community

The small city of Ferguson has changed from predominantly white to having a majority black population in the last few decades. In 1970, Ferguson was 99% white; now, the city has a 29% white population and 67% black. The police department, however, does not reflect the demographics of the town's residents — {only three}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-department-diversity-questioned-officers/13976879/""> of the 53-officer department are black. The police chief, Thomas Jackson, is white.

2. Black people account for most arrests in Ferguson

Last year, black residents accounted for 86% of the {vehicle stops}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf""> made by Ferguson police and nearly 93% of the arrests made from those stops, according to the {state attorney general}<hyperlink=""http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf"">. FBI statistics show that 85% of the people arrested by Ferguson police are black, and that 92% of people arrested specifically for disorderly conduct are black.

3. Crime has decreased

In 2008, the town's crime rate was significantly higher than the state average, but since then, violent crime has consistently dropped each year. There were 163 instances of violent crime in Ferguson in 2008 and only 80 in 2012, according FBI data.

4. Ferguson Police Department's role, compared with other area police

The officer accused of fatally shooting 18-year-old Mike Brown is from the Ferguson Police Department, but the department turned the investigation over to St. Louis County Police. A visible force in confrontations with protesters — wearing riot gear, driving tanks, and using tear gas and stun guns on protesters — the county police have made headlines, including for {arresting journalists}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/13/reporters-arrested-ferguson/14038067/""> from the Washington Post and Huffington Post.

On Thursday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon promised a ""different tone"" and an {""operational shift""}<hyperlink=""http://ux-origin.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/ferguson-missouri-police-clashes-shooting-anonymous/14046707/""> by the police armed near the demonstrations, naming Missouri Highway Patrol head of security.

5. The police uses military equipment from the Department of Defense

The Ferguson Police Department is part of the DoD 1033 program, which distributes surplus military equipment, including automatic weapons and heavy armored vehicles such as MRAPS, to local police departments across the United States. Law enforcement agencies in St. Louis County received 12 5.56 millimeter rifles and six .45 caliber pistols from the program between August 2010 and February 2013 and Ferguson is one of those agencies.

An official from the Defense Logistics Agency said the town's department most recently acquired two vehicles, a trailer and a generator in November. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said, ""It's not a military, it's tactical operations,"" during a press conference on Thursday.",36,1370,NA,"Title - “The”?, hyperlink doesn't work for “vehicle stops” and “state attorney general”"
USAToday,usa15,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/17/justice-department-autopsy-brown-ferguson/14196559/,"After Brown autopsy, mom wants officer arrested",Yamiche Alcindor; John Bacon,08/18/2014,11/11/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. — A preliminary autopsy report has convinced the family of Michael Brown that the police officer who shot him should be arrested, a lawyer for the family said Monday.

""His mother asked the questions that ... lawyers could not answer -- what else do we need to get them to arrest the killer of my child?"" lawyer Benjamin Crump said at a news conference here.

Crump said Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, asked if her son suffered pain before he died. Pathologist Michael Baden, who conducted the autopsy at the family's request, ""shared his opinion that he did not suffer,"" Crump said.

Baden, who also spoke at the news conference, said Brown, 18, was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. None of the bullets entered from the back, and three were recovered from Brown's body, he said.

Brown could have survived all of his wounds except for the shot to the top of his head, Baden said. That shot was probably sustained last, hitting Brown as he was bending over, and exited through his right eye, he said.

Baden said Brown was shot from at least one foot away but the distance could have been as far as 30 feet. Baden said six bullets entered Brown's body and at least two bullets ricocheted and traveled back through his body. Bullet wounds to Brown's arms could have been sustained by putting his hands up or crossing his arms.

Baden said his results could be consistent with police or witness accounts of how Brown died. Crump's position was clear.

""It verifies the worst that the family thinks happened — that he was executed,"" Crump told USA TODAY. ""It confirms what the witnesses said, that this was an execution. That's what the witnesses said from day one.

""It's so hard for his mother and father to even deal with the notion that this is what happened,"" Crump said. ""It's obvious his hands were up at some point because you can tell how the bullet goes from in and out.""

Brown was unarmed when Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, 28, shot him on a street Aug. 9. Witnesses in the area said Brown had raised his hands to surrender when he was shot. The shooting and police response drew racially charged protests that have sometimes turned violent.

Baden said a final autopsy report would require study of the clothes Brown was wearing to see if they contained gunshot residue, which would indicate whether at least one shot was fired at close range. No residue was found on Brown's body, Baden said.

Baden said he also needs eyewitness and toxicology reports.

The St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy concluded that Brown died of gunshot wounds, but other details have not been released. The Washington Post, citing a person familiar with that autopsy, said the county autopsy indicates Brown was shot six to eight times and had marijuana in his system.

STORY: Shootings, arrests bring more chaos to Ferguson

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Sunday ordered a separate, third federal autopsy.

Citing the ""extraordinary'' nature of the case, Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said Holder directed the action at the request of Brown's family.

The Justice Department is conducting a separate inquiry into possible civil rights violations, related to the shooting. About 40 FBI agents had been deployed to the investigation at the start to assist in canvassing the local neighborhoods for witnesses.

FBI agents also have joined local authorities in some witness interviews related to Brown's shooting after those witnesses expressed doubts about the integrity of the local inquiry, a federal law enforcement official said Saturday.

The official, who is not authorized to comment publicly, said the joint interviews have involved few witnesses so far. But the concerns echo themes from waves of protesters during the past week who have cited a broken trust with local police.",888,17241,NA,same gallery from USA1
USAToday,usa16,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/17/mo-ferguson-curfew-brown-police-shooting/14190517/,"Shootings, arrests bring more chaos to Ferguson",Yamiche Alcindor,08/19/2014,11/11/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Seven people were arrested and one person was shot early Sunday as police and protesters clashed again in a haze of tear gas despite a curfew that took effect at midnight.

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson said the shooting victim was in critical condition. Johnson said police used tear gas in an effort to reach the wounded person, but that other protesters already had taken the shooting victim to the hospital, Johnson said.

It was not clear who fired the shot, but Gov. Jay Nixon said Sunday that no police officers fired their guns during or after the protest.

Seven people will face charges of failure to disperse. Early Sunday, members of the media were ordered to remain in the parking lot of the Ferguson Market or risk arrest.

The curfew, put in place by Nixon, was designed to quell ongoing unrest in the St. Louis suburb since the Aug. 9 fatal police shooting of Brown by officer Darren Wilson. Police also released a surveillance video purporting to show Brown stealing from a convenience store and roughing up its clerk about 15 minutes before the confrontation with Wilson.

""We were unaware they were going to release it, and we certainly were not happy with that being released,"" Nixon told ABC's This Week on Sunday. ""It appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw.""

Also Sunday, the Justice Department said it would arrange for an another, ""independent"" autopsy of Brown's body ""due to the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family.""

The St. Louis County Medical Examiner's autopsy concluded that Brown died of gunshot wounds, but other details have not been released.

The curfew expired at 5 a.m. local time. Crowds had dwindled significantly leading up to the curfew, but remaining protesters — chanting ""No justice! No curfew!"" — refused to leave the area. Some stood with their hands up, the emblematic pose used by many protesters to characterize the position witness have said Brown had assumed when he was fatally shot.

""We ready. We ready. We ready for y'all, "" people chanted, while others screamed, ""We are Mike Brown.""

About 45 minutes past the curfew deadline, armored tactical vehicles approached the crowd in an effort to disperse those that refused to leave West Florissant Avenue, a main thoroughfare and scene of numerous protests.

""You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew. You must disperse immediately. Failure to comply may result in arrest,"" officers said through a loudspeaker.

As officers put on gas masks, a chant from the distant crowd emerged: ""We have the right to assemble peacefully.""

Police used smoke and tear gas to push back the crowd of protesters, and officers also carried rifles, gas masks, plastic handcuffs and helmets.

Police also brought in armored tanks after learning of some disturbances at Reds Barbecue, a local restaurant. En route, officers encountered a man who flashed a handgun and appeared in the middle of the street as armored vehicles approached the crowd of protesters, Johnson said.

Johnson said someone also fired at a patrol car, but no officers were injured.

Johnson defended the use of military-style armored cars and tactical units dressed like soldiers. The situations faced by police justified their actions and tactics, he said.

""We have a shooting victim that is in critical condition that may lose their life,"" Johnson said. ""We had a subject standing in the middle of the road with a handgun. We had a police car shot at tonight.""

St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who represents the 21st Ward, said he and other community members pleaded with everyone to obey the curfew.

""Some of the guys didn't want to be told to leave,"" French said. ""There was no convincing them. They wanted to do civil disobedience.""

Umar Lee, 39, an independent journalist, who said he grew up in North St. Louis, saw protesters were throwing canisters of gas deployed by the police back at the police during the tense clashes.

""This is surreal to see my hometown look like Gaza,"" Lee said. ""I just pray for peace in my community.""

Nixon, however, told CNN on Sunday he was encouraged by the most recent events.

""Thousands of people spoke, thousands of people marched, not a single gunshot from police last night,"" Nixon said. ""We are trying to use the least amount of force to provide people with protection.""

Nixon also said it was important to have thorough local and FBI investigations completed as soon as possible.

""Attorney General Holder said he is putting 40 agents into the area to accelerate the process,"" Nixon said. ""It's important to get this right. It has to be transparent justice, it has to be thorough justice.""",642,7927,NA,NA

This is a hard working, church going and middle-to-working class community with families struggling economically to keep their heads above water. There is also a smaller but growing poor community in Ferguson. It reflects what's happening in America generally. When journalists and politicians speak of a dwindling middle class that's under economic assault and a poor community that's getting bigger, they're talking about Ferguson. Independent of the racial demographics and dynamics of Ferguson, Missouri, there's a ""Ferguson"" near you.

Since President {Lyndon Johnson}<hyperlink=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/lyndonbjohnson"">, there has been no significant urban, suburban, small town or rural policy to rebuild America.

Republicans are the party of ""no"" and Democrats are the party of ""don't know"" because it hasn't fought for bold ideas, policies or plans to turn us in a new direction. Policies of community development are being replaced with policies of community containment. The absence of a domestic {Marshall Plan}<hyperlink=""http://marshallfoundation.org/marshall/the-marshall-plan/""> is being replaced with martial law.

Here's America today: high unemployment and low graduation rates result in guns and drugs in and jobs out; hospitals and public schools closing; gym, art, music and trade skills taken out of our public schools; inadequate investments being made in our infrastructure with roads crumbling, bridges falling down and an outdated public transportation system; a failure to address climate change; denial of capital investment for entrepreneurs; abandoned homes and vacant lots; a lack of youth recreational opportunities; frivolous entertainment, texting and Twitter replacing serious news reporting, reading, writing and arithmetic; a cutback in funding and a denial of equal opportunity in public jobs such as for teachers, policemen and firemen; all of which leads to hopelessness, despair and cynicism.

Many are observing Ferguson and witnessing the anger, demonstrations, looting and vandalism and calling for quiet. But quiet isn't enough. The absence of noise isn't the presence of justice — and we must demand justice in Ferguson and the other ""Fergusons"" around America.

Too many Americans have adjusted to injustice and inequality. But injustice and inequality anywhere is a threat to justice and equality everywhere.

Police Chief Thomas Jackson had said he would reveal the officer's name by noon Tuesday. Police department spokesman Timothy Zoll said because of the threats there is now no timetable for release of the name.

Witnesses say Michael Brown, 18, had raised his hands to surrender when the shots were fired. Police have not confirmed that information.

Monday night, officers in riot gear lobbed tear gas at crowds angered by the weekend shooting. There were 15 arrests but no reports of looting.

""This is a lot of young people reacting to getting shot at with tear gas, being met with riot gear,"" said protester Shawn Jordan. ""How else are these young kids going to react when they are being met with aggressiveness?""

Jackson said members of the crowd threw rocks at police and gunfire came from the crowd, so officers used tear gas and shot ""beanbag rounds"" meant to stun them. Jackson said police blocked off the area where most of the looting and vandalism occurred the previous night out of concern that cars passing by might hit demonstrators in the street.

At a community forum Monday, national NAACP President Cornell William Brooks demanded justice while condemning the violence and looting.

""Martin Luther King did not live and die that we might steal and lie in the name of justice in the middle of the night,"" said Cornell. ""He lived and died that we might seek justice in the middle of the day.""

Sunday night, two police officers were injured and 32 arrested during riots that broke out. Demands for answers in Ferguson have been steadily growing louder.

The FBI opened an investigation Monday into the death of Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday after being confronted by an officer in the predominately black St. Louis suburb of 21,000.

Authorities were vague about exactly what led the officer to open fire, except to say that the shooting was preceded by a scuffle of some kind with a man. It was unclear whether Brown or the man he was with was involved in the altercation.

Investigators have refused to publicly disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave. But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.

A protest in front of St. Louis County prosecuting attorney Bob McCulloch's office was scheduled for Tuesday.

""I don't want to sugarcoat it, their baby was executed in broad daylight,"" said Crump, who stood by Brown's parents during a press conference Monday night. ""We want to know and see exactly what happened because this family rejects what the police authorities said at their press conference.""

Crump said Brown's death is an echo of the problems that led to the deaths of Trayvon Martin and other young black men.

Demonstrators expressed similar frustrations with many saying Brown's death is the latest example of black life not being valued by police officers who see youth of color as dangerous. Several on Twitter using the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown expressed their anger over Brown's death.",969,16112,NA,NA

Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew in Ferguson, Mo., on Saturday, following nights of protests after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer.

""If we're going to have justice, we must first have and maintain peace,"" Nixon said at a Saturday afternoon press conference. ""The eyes of the world are watching.""

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol says the curfew will run from midnight to 5 a.m. local time Sunday and will be enforced through conversations, not tear gas and tanks.

""We will survive this and will make a change,"" Johnson says.

Malik Shabazz, a member of Black Lawyers for Justice, said he has been working with a coalition of groups to help disperse crowds and keep the peace in Ferguson for the past several days.

Now, he is worried the curfew will make it harder for him to help authorities. He thinks the curfew asks people to go home too early. The past few nights, Shabazz said, people went home around 1:30 a.m.

He asked Johnson to extend the curfew during the news conference, where it was announced. Johnson however said it would stand.

""I don't want our people to get hurt,"" he said. ""It's Saturday night. Twelve midnight is an early time. ... I can't be responsible for his timeline so it is what it is.""

Margaret Huang, deputy executive director of Amnesty International USA, disagrees with the curfew.

""It's clear that the community doesn't feel heard,"" Huang says. ""It's hard to build trust when the governor won't meet with community members and restricts their movements with a curfew. The people of Ferguson should not have their rights further restricted.""

Daniel Moore, 42, of Ferguson said he thought a curfew would only make things more tense among protesters and the police. Moore said he fears police will use the curfew as an excuse to harass people on foot and in cars.

""It's stupid,"" Moore said as he stood among fellow protesters at QuikTrip. ""They just want to control everything. ... I guess they (want) us to obey — I can't tell if I will.""

Derrick Brown, 25, said he was optimistic that people would abide by the curfew but wasn't sure whether he supported it.

""It'll be interesting to see the crowd move at midnight,"" Brown said. ""I'm curious to see how that process will unfold.""

FBI agents have joined local authorities in some witness interviews related to the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer, after those witnesses expressed doubts about the integrity of the local inquiry, a federal law enforcement official said Saturday.

The official, who is not authorized to comment publicly, said the joint interviews have involved few witnesses so far. But the concerns echo themes from waves of protesters during the past week who have cited a broken trust with local police.

Local authorities are heading the investigation into last week's deadly shooting, while the FBI is conducting a parallel inquiry into possible federal civil rights violations.

In a statement issued Friday evening, William Woods, the FBI's special agent in charge, U.S. Attorney Richard Callahan and Molly Moran, acting chief of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division confirmed that federal authorities had already conducted ""several'' witness interviews.

""Over the next several days, teams of FBI agents will be canvassing the neighborhood where the shooting took place to identify any individuals who may have information related to the shooting and have not yet come forward,'' the officials said.

The developments came after armored vehicles, riot gear, tear gas and looting returned to Ferguson early Saturday as a brief period of peaceful demonstrations gave way to a violent atmosphere of anarchy.

The intense night shattered a short-lived calm that had been hailed as a turning point after a week of protests following the fatal shooting of Brown, a black unarmed teenager killed by Darren Wilson one week ago.

Renita Lamkin, 43, is the pastor of St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church in St. Charles, Mo. Each day since the protests began Lamkin has been at the front of the protest line urging people to remain calm. The curfew is necessary, she said, to keep the focus on Brown's death rather than looting.

Angela Whitman, 44, of Berkeley, St. Louis, helped organize a moment of silence for Brown on Saturday afternoon. The group stood in silence for 30 minutes with their hands up across the street from the Ferguson Police Station.

She said that tensions would remain high until Brown's killer was arrested.

WASHINGTON — Faced with a pair of violent crises, President Obama said Monday he is seeing progress in Iraq and announced he is dispatching Attorney General Eric Holder to monitor the unrest over a police shooting in a St. Louis suburb.

Hours after being briefed by Holder on events in Ferguson, Mo., Obama again called for calm and said people there should push back on ""a small minority"" that is undermining peaceful protest by fomenting violence.

""Let's seek to heal rather than to wound each other,"" Obama said at the White House.

While there are legitimate concerns raised by the shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old black man, Obama said, the solution does not involve looting and attacking police with Molotov cocktails. ""They are damaging the cause,"" he said. ""They are not advancing it.""

Obama called on people to address ""the gulf of mistrust"" that exists between minorities and law enforcement, with respect for all sides. He said police should re-examine the use of heavy military equipment in dealing with protests and hopes that use of the National Guard will be ""limited.""

After a day of briefings at the White House, Obama also said the United States is seeing progress in the Iraq military operation, citing the recapture of the nation's largest dam near Mosul.

Militant control of that dam, which controls so much of Iraq's water supply, could have been ""catastrophic,"" Obama said, leading to ""floods that would've threatened the lives of thousands of civilians and endanger our embassy compound in Baghdad.""

Obama also praised the help of allies in Iraq, saying the Iraqis continue to make progress on forming a united and inclusive government as it battles the militant group known as the Islamic State, or ISIL.

""Let's remember ISIL poses a threat to all Iraqis and to the entire region,"" Obama said.

Obama said he could not put a timeline on efforts to subdue ISIL, but said he is on guard against ""mission creep"" in Iraq. He repeated there would be no return of American combat troops on the ground in Iraq.

The president spoke after a pair of briefings on the two topics he discussed.

Earlier in the afternoon, Holder and aides briefed Obama on the investigation into the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson.

During the morning, Obama heard from members of his National Security Council about the ongoing military operation in Iraq. The national security meeting took place in the Roosevelt Room rather than the Situation Room, which is undergoing maintenance and an upgrade.

Obama — who returned to the White House after midnight from his vacation on Martha's Vineyard, Mass. — is scheduled to fly back to the island on Tuesday for a vacation that ends Sunday.

The Aug. 9 shooting in Ferguson has triggered protests, including from African Americans who have long criticized police's treatment of them.

Holder will be in Ferguson on Wednesday to talk with FBI agents and Justice Department officials involved in the investigation of Brown's death, Obama said. Holder, he added, will also meet ""with other leaders in the community whose support is so critical to bringing about peace and calm in Ferguson.""

Obama, the nation's first African-American president, said racial disparities in the criminal justice system need to be addressed. He said individuals are responsible for their own actions.

""Here are young black men that commit crime,"" Obama said. ""And we can argue about why that happens: because of the poverty they were born into, or the lack of opportunity. or the school systems that failed them or what have you. But if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted, because every community has an interest in public safety.""

Early Monday morning, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon called out the National Guard to restore order in the community near St. Louis where some of the protests have turned violent. Later, the governor ended a short-lived curfew.

Obama said he spoke with Nixon and asked that the National Guard be used in ""a limited and appropriate way."" The president said, ""I'll be watching over the next several days to assess whether, in fact, it's helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson.""

The National Security Council meeting consisted of an overall update on Iraq, according to the White House schedule.

Earlier this month, Obama authorized airstrikes of militants who threaten U.S. personnel and Kurdish citizens in northern Iraq.

On Monday, Iraqi forces said they have retaken control of the nation's largest dam from the Islamic State militants.

The operation has included humanitarian aid to religious minorities trapped atop a mountain in Iraq. The administration considered a rescue mission, but determined that most of those trapped had escaped.

The Obama administration is also pushing Iraq to form a national government that includes all three major religious sects — Sunnis, Shias and Kurds — the key to success against ISIL, the president said.

""With that new government in place, Iraqis will be able to unite the country against the threat from ISIL,"" Obama said. ""And they will be able to look forward to increased support, not just from the United States, but from other countries in the region and around the world.""",256,4522,NA,NA
USAToday,usa21,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/18/ferguson-michael-brown-rodney-king-riots/14226467/,Analysis: Seeking a path to peace in Ferguson,Yamiche Alcindor; Larry Copeland; Rick Hampson,08/19/2014,11/17/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. — The National Guard's arrival may bring order to this troubled community. It probably won't bring peace.

It didn't in Newark and Detroit after race riots in 1967, nor in Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict in 1992. However necessary, sending in the Guard — as Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon did in Ferguson early Monday — is typically an admission of failure that becomes as much a part of a community's stigma as the violence it's designed to stop.

""It's the worst scenario,'' said Eugene O'Donnell, a former police officer and prosecutor who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. ""It's an indictment of the political establishment, of civil society itself. It says there's so much despair and alienation that you need a military occupation. It shames the country to see soldiers patrolling the streets.''

In Ferguson and across the nation, Americans debated what could bring peace here and, implicitly, maintain it in many similar cities and towns.

""What's happening in Ferguson could happen in a lot of places,'' said Thomas Reppetto, former president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City and once a commander of police detectives in Chicago. ""Who ever heard of Ferguson before this?''

He and O'Donnell said the volatile intersection of poverty, racial tensions and policing can produce an explosion almost anywhere, anytime. And the damage lingers long after the tear gas has blown away.

The National Guard is the next-to-last resort before the Army (82nd Airborne Division, Detroit, '67) and Marines (1st Division, L.A., '92) for quelling a civil disturbance. Usually the Guard makes the situation better; sometimes (Newark, '67) it arguably makes it worse.

And, in many cases, the Guard's imposition of order eventually proved to be a hollow accomplishment. It couldn't stop the flight of white residents and businesspeople from Detroit and Newark after 1967; after the 1965 riots, most whites left South-Central Los Angeles; after the 1992 ones, many blacks did, too. Many buildings that burned down still haven't been rebuilt.

In Ferguson, the Guard's deployment came nine days after the shooting of an unarmed black teen, Michael Brown, by a white policeman. The shooting touched off a week of bitter and sometimes violent protests in this racially mixed, working class suburb of St. Louis.

As multiple investigations of the shooting continued, a detailed account from officer Darren Wilson had still not been heard. Ferguson's police chief has referred to a scuffle between Brown and Wilson and released surveillance video of a strong-armed robbery Brown allegedly committed at a convenience store moments before he was fatally shot.

Nixon's decision to call in the Guard followed a series of other moves designed to contain the situation. Command was shifted from the Ferguson Police Department, first to county police, then to the state Highway Patrol under the leadership of Capt. Ronald Johnson, a black officer with local ties. A midnight-to-dawn curfew was imposed (and then called off on Monday).

Bernard Melekian, the Justice Department's former director of community policing, said the Guard can fill a need in Ferguson.

""There were steps that probably could have been taken in the first days, but here we are at Day 9, and now it is critical … to ensure the protection of lives and property,'' said Melekian, former police chief of Pasadena, Calif. ""It could help provide some breathing room — some space to put some faith back in the (investigative) process.''

The Guard's presence alone will not ensure peace, he said, adding, ""Trust is a valid question here.'' Melekian said investigators should find a credible, independent party to oversee the inquiry into the fatal shooting.

""Now that everyone has chosen sides, anytime the local authorities release information that doesn't jibe with the family's understanding, there are going to be more questions,"" Melekian said.

Joseph McNamara, a former Kansas City police chief and research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, said local authorities in Ferguson ""did everything wrong you could possibly do.''

""The way this has gotten away from them is a shocking kind of thing to see,'' McNamara said. Going forward, the former chief said Ferguson police and other law enforcement officials ""have to recalibrate their policies on the use of deadly force.''

One protester, Shirlissa Pruitt, 41, said the National Guard's presence made her want to keep protesting: ""It reassures me that now is not the time to rest … because the things they are doing are still unlawful. ... It's kind of like a jail for the neighborhood. You are going to have to get up at a certain time, go to the store at a certain time and move around at a certain time.""

Ben Mengis, 55, said action needs to come from the city, not the state. ""Ferguson does not need the governor of Missouri coming in telling them the police department is not up to standards. I think the City Council needs to sit down and fire the police chief. Then you're sending a signal that the police chief is not our chief, we're his chief.""'

President Obama himself sounded skeptical about the Guard's use. He said at a news conference Monday afternoon that ""I'll be watching to see that it's helping, not hindering, progress.""

All of which begged the question: How can peace be restored in Ferguson?

""With justice,'' Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said in an interview with ABC News. Asked what justice meant to her, she said, ""Being fair. Arresting this man (Darren Wilson, the officer who shot her son) and making him accountable for his actions.''

Elsewhere in Ferguson, opinion varied among protesters as to what it would take to bring calm:

• ""Barack Obama needs to do his damn job. He needs to get down here personally and give us federal protection, not state protection. He needs to stop dillying and dallying. The National Guard is here, but they live here. They grew up with the (police) troublemakers.'' — Mauricelm-Lei Millere, chairman of the Black Nationalist Network of Washington, who has led marches, including one Sunday night at which marchers were tear gassed.

• ""It's not about black or white. It's about making sure the law is executed properly."" — Bishop Larry Jones, pastor and founder of Greater Grace Church in St. Louis, who said people may be relieved if Wilson faces criminal charges.

• ""The removal of all current leaders — Ferguson's police chief, Ferguson's mayor, and the county prosecutor. You can't remove one without the others. They are a collective organization."" — Pruitt, a personal chef and law school student. That organization, she said, has encouraged unfair policing, use of military-style tactics on protestors and created schools that fail Ferguson's children.

Martin Luther King III, son of the civil rights leader, told CNN that, based on his conversations with black community leaders, he thinks tensions could be eased by the appointment of a special criminal prosecutor in the shooting.

(The Associated Press reported that the official overseeing the investigation, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, has deep family roots among police: His father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for St. Louis' police department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect.)

There also was this suggestion from Obama: ""Let's seek to heal, rather than wound each other.'' The solution, he said, was to ""build, not tear down. Listen, and not just shout. That's how we're going to move forward.''

Not everyone agreed that the fault rested with Ferguson's government, which is dominated by the city's white minority, and police force, which is predominantly white. Mayor James Knowles, who is white, told KSDK-TV that the city wants to hire black cops, but that many young African Americans aren't interested.

""We hire every (qualified African American) that we can get,'' he said. But ""a lot of young African-American people don't want to go into law enforcement. They already have this disconnect with law enforcement, so if we find people who want to go into law enforcement who are African-American, we're all over it because we want them to help us bridge the gap.""

Meanwhile, the fundraising site Gofundme.com had a Facebook page asking for money for Wilson. It reads: ""We stand behind Officer Darren Wilson and his family during this trying time.''

Despite everything — from the arrival of a military unit hardened by what its commander described as ""many overseas missions'' to the looted storefronts on West Florissant Avenue — Bishop Jones said he was optimistic.

""I predict a great future for Ferguson,'' he said, as long as its people ""can gather around the table and keep talking and help with the healing.''

Talia Lowe, a 39-year-old protester who works at a rap studio, was of two minds.

On one hand, she said calm could return to Ferguson after Brown is buried and mourners can begin to process their pain and anger. But she said things also could get worse: ""I think after the funeral, it's going to be a riot. Everybody is going to be upset and emotional when that day actually comes.""",144,1432,NA,NA

""While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting or carrying guns, and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos,"" Obama said during his brief news conference Tuesday. ""It undermines rather than advancing justice.""

Obama has questioned some of the circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, but stressed that an investigation is ongoing. He has defended the right of police to maintain order, but criticized the use of excessive force, including the arrests of reporters.

""This is not an argument that there isn't real crime out there, and that law enforcement doesn't have a difficult job and that they have to be honored and respected for the danger and difficulty of law enforcement,"" Obama said.

But the ""gulf of mistrust"" between police and African-Americans cannot be ignored, he said, and everyone must work to make sure ""that our criminal justice system is acutely aware of the possibilities of disparities in treatment, there are safeguards in place to avoid those disparities.""

FULL COVERAGE: The Michael Brown shooting

STORY: Calm returns to Ferguson after night of chaos

The president said that protesters have legitimate grievances, both over the death of Brown as well as historic treatment of African-Americans by police. He has also criticized those demonstrators who have looted stores and thrown Molotov cocktails at police.

""It's clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting,"" Obama said. ""What's also clear is that a small minority of individuals are not.""

In discussing My Brother's Keeper and other efforts to help young men of color, Obama said ""there are young black men that commit crime. And we can argue about why that happened -- because of the poverty they were born into and the lack of opportunity, or the schools systems that failed them, or what have you.

""But,"" he added, ""if they commit a crime, then they need to be prosecuted because every community has an interest in public safety.""

Obama, an attorney as well as the nation's first African-American president, has also been careful about speaking on a pending investigation.

The president has not spoken about Brown's death with the emotion he did when discussing the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin. In that case, however, Obama spoke out more after the trial of the man who shot Martin -- legal proceedings in the Ferguson case seem far off.

""I have to be very careful about not pre-judging these events before investigations are completed,"" Obama said. ""Although these are issues of local jurisdiction, the DOJ works for me and when they're conducting an investigation I've got to make sure that I don't look like I'm putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other.""",48,893,NA,NA

Michael Brown's family and legal representatives said they were ""outraged'' that Ferguson Chief Thomas Jackson implicated the teenager as a suspect in a theft of cigars from a convenience store at the same time the long-sought identity of the shooter, Officer Darren Wilson, was disclosed.

""The prolonged release of the officer's name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies,'' the Brown family said in a written statement.

""It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him,'' the statement continued, referring to surveillance images that the police released Friday linking Brown as a possible suspect in a convenience store robbery.

Jackson later told reporters that he released the images because he ""had to,'' based on several formal requests from media organizations.

Law enforcement analysts said it is not uncommon for police to offer some possible explanation for officers' decisions to use deadly force. But the release nearly a week after the shooting and in wake of police clashes with the community risked sowing additional distrust.

""If a police department feels it has some basis to take the action it did, it's pretty common to release this kind of information,'' said Bill Geller, who has done extensive research on police use of deadly force. ""Whether that explanation will play out, that's a whole separate question.''

Dennis Nowicki, a law enforcement consultant and former Charlotte-Mecklenburg police chief, said that transparency generally ""goes a long way toward building confidence in the community.

""But the subsequent release of information (in this case) may suffer because of a lack of transparency from the beginning,'' Nowicki said. ""My belief is that you share as much information as you can when you have it.''

University of Pittsburgh law professor David Harris, who has written extensively on police conduct matters, said the decision by Ferguson, Mo., police to reverse course and identify the officer involved in the shooting clearly showed that withholding the information was ""costing them too much'' in the community.

""I don't like the spin they put on it,'' Harris said, referring to additional information that characterized Brown as a possible suspect in a local robbery. ""But I think that's what they should be doing going forward, being as transparent as they can. In retrospect, though, in the next several days, I think we'll be more focused on what happened'' in the moments leading up to the shooting.

In Ferguson, the police department's new communications strategy was clearly not winning the day.

Justin Dear, 25, who said he knew Brown for about a year and a half before the teen was gunned down, also was angered that police had released the information implicating Brown as a robbery suspect.

""It's crazy because they are still trying to figure out a way to cover up this cop,"" Dear said. ""They are trying to paint this bad picture out of a good kid.""

Dozens of protesters echoed feelings of frustration and distrust about the timing of the release. Many said the officer's name should have been released days ago and not along with robbery information.

""It's like they are trying to take the focus off what the real issues are,"" said Terry Jones, 47, of Ferguson. ""The timing was bad. It's like a diversion to prolong justice for Mike Brown.""",125,976,NA,NA

On Sunday, Missouri State Highway Patrol superintendent Col. Ron Replogle announced the curfew, which came as protesters and police continued to clash a week after the Aug. 9 fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, by officer Darren Wilson.

Seven people were arrested and one person was shot early Sunday as police and protesters clashed again in a haze of tear gas despite the curfew.

It was not clear who fired the shot, but Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said no police officers fired their guns during or after the protest. He told CNN that the police ""are trying to use the least amount of force to provide people the ability to speak, while also protecting the property of Ferguson.""

Nixon didn't say when he foresaw the curfew ending or whether it would be extended further, but added, ""We'd like to see it ratcheted down. What we'd like to see, that will be judged by the community."" Nixon said he was ""heartened"" by people's response to the curfew early Sunday.

Anger has grown in recent days after police on Friday released a surveillance video purporting to show Brown stealing from a convenience store and roughing up its clerk about 15 minutes before the confrontation with Wilson.

""We were unaware they were going to release it, and we certainly were not happy with that being released,"" Nixon told ABC's This Week on Sunday. ""It appeared to cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street. It made emotions raw.""

Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said early Tuesday that 31 people were arrested, four police officers were injured by thrown rocks and bottles, at least two people were shot, and two fires were set during a night of clashes between police and protesters.

NewsChannel 5 later confirmed that 54 people were arrested for failure to disperse.

Johnson said ""officers came under heavy gunfire"" during the night, but said officers did not fire a single shot. They ""acted with restraint and calm,"" he said.

Amid the tense situation, a group of people trying to keep the peace locked arms and managed to position themselves between the more confrontational protesters and the police line. However, while many among the protesters clamored for calm, some in the crowd appeared determined to provoke an incident.

Johnson said some of those arrested were from as far away as New York and California — part of what he called ""a dangerous dynamic of the night.""

""Our peaceful protesters are not the enemy,"" Johnson said. ""Tonight we closed the roadway; we allowed those who come in peace to walk the roadway.""

Police ordered the media to move away from the scene of the confrontation to their command center, about one mile away.

Earlier, Scott Olson, a news photographer with Getty Images, became the latest journalist to be arrested, according to Pancho Bernasconi, Getty's vice president for news. He was later released, and in a statement Getty said he would continue working in Ferguson.

And before the protests escalated, demonstrators crowded around well known rapper Nelly, who is from St. Louis, and who was marching with protesters in Ferguson Monday night.

""It's a lot of people out for themselves that's out here right now,"" Nelly said. ""They are overshadowing people.""

He added that people needed a solution that goes past traditional ways of protesting.

""The way we approach the problem is the same every single time,"" Nelly said. ""We get angry. We march. We sing ... We don't strategize. All we do is react.""

Others had their own tense encounters with the police. In one instance Monday afternoon, St. Louis County police officers arrested a man walking on a sidewalk.

Two police officers tackled the man to the ground while onlookers shouted that the man wasn't doing anything wrong.

""I didn't see anybody behaving in any way that would instigate for the police to do anything,"" said Ben Mengis, 55, of St. Louis County, who said he was standing 10 feet from the incident. ""He did not do anything.""

A police spokesman could not be reached for comment.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Monday dropped the curfew that had been in effect for two nights in an ill-fated effort to curb the violence and chaos that have ripped this city since Brown, an unarmed black pedestrian, was shot to death by white police officer Darren Wilson, 28, on Aug. 9.

Nixon announced that the National Guard would assume ""limited responsibilities"" to help keep order during nighttime protests over the shooting.

Most of the National Guard units that had been summoned by Nixon appeared early Tuesday to be keeping their distance from the protests and protecting a police staging area.

""With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence, and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard,"" Nixon said in a written statement.

""This has to stop,"" Johnson said early Tuesday morning. ""I don't want anyone to get hurt. I don't want an officer to get hurt, I don't want a citizen to get hurt. We have to find a way to stop it.""

A grand jury may begin hearing the case on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. It was unclear how long it might take for a decision on whether Wilson should face criminal charges for Brown's death.",9,217,NA,NA

A police offense incident report dated Aug. 9 that was part of the packet of documents Ferguson, Mo. Police Chief Thomas Jackson released quotes the officer writing, ""I was able to confirm that Brown is the primary suspect in this incident.""

The report does not name the officer or contain an officer's signature. It also does not contain the address where the robbery is said to have happened.

But it provides the following description of the robbery: An employee at a Ferguson convenience store saw Brown grab a box of Swisher Sweet cigars and hand them to another young man identified as Dorrian Johnson, who was standing behind him.

The employee said he told Brown he had to pay for the cigars and instead, Brown reached across the counter and grabbed numerous packets of cigars and turned to leave the store.

The report says according to the employee Brown grabbed his shirt and pushed him into a display rack. Then he and Johnson left the store without paying.

The report describes Brown as 6'4, 292 pounds and wearing a white T-shirt, khaki long shorts, yellow socks and a red Cardinals baseball cap.

Jackson released dispatch records and video surveillance of the robbery as well.

Brown was unarmed when Wilson killed him. Witnesses in the area say Brown had raised his hands to surrender when he was shot. Police have not confirmed that information.

The violence began after a planned rally and vigil in the wake of the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Brown was the unarmed teenager {shot to death}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/09/police-shooting-ferguson/13832083/""> by an Ferguson police officer on Saturday afternoon.

Police officers from every jurisdiction in the St. Louis area were called into Ferguson Sunday evening. The strong police presence became necessary after {violence and looting}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/08/10/rioting-breaks-out-in-ferguson/13880305/""> were reported in the area. Witnesses say tensions began rising at the intersection of West Florissant and Ferguson around 8:30 p.m. In response Ferguson police called in an extra 60 officers as well as officers from all surrounding jurisdictions.

Officer Brian Schellman with the St. Louis County Police Department says 200 officers were called to the area from at least two dozen departments, but approximately 300 total officers were in the area. Many officers who were not called in responded anyway.

Two police officers were injured Sunday night during the unrest. One of those officers was hit by a brick, the other suffered a knee injury. They are both expected to be okay. One St. Louis County police officer was shot at, but was not injured.

Police say 32 arrests were made during the chaos. At least 12 businesses were looted. At least one shot was fired at a police helicopter. Rocks, bricks, and bottles were thrown at police officers throughout the night. There's no word on how many patrol cars were damaged.

A focal point of the violent actions by some was the Quiktrip store in the 9400 block of West Florissant. Video obtained by NewsChannel 5 showed the store being actively looted and later, {someone set the store on fire}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/11/ferguson-quiktrip-burned-down/13884675/"">.Additional looting was also reported at a liquor store near the Ferguson Quiktrip, as well as fire reported behind the building where the liquor store is located.

Zisser Tire & Auto in Dellwood was vandalized during the unrest. Windows were smashed in, tires and rims were stolen, tires were thrown through windows, and glass is lining the streets.

Police are staging across the street from the store and watching the area.

TEAR GAS DISPERSED
A NewsChannel 5 crew reported that tear gas has been dispensed as rioting and looting continued into the early Monday morning hours. Reporter Elizabeth Matthews was preparing for a report from the corner of West Florissant and Highmont Drive, when she began feeling the affects of the tear gas in the area.

""My nose is burning, my eyes are burning, my throat is burning and officers near by are dealing with this too,"" said Matthews in a live report.

All of this is unfolding along Florissant Avenue, where NewsChannel 5 reporter Elizabeth Matthews and photojournalist Don Galloway were working. Matthews reports seeing more then half a dozen individuals breaking into the store, followed by dozens of others as the looting began.

The day began with Chief Jon Belmar with the St. Louis County Police Department {holding a news conference}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/10/ferguson-police-news-conference-michael-brown/13860601/""> Sunday morning and releasing new information about the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Belmar said the incident started when Brown physically assaulted the police officer, pushing him into the officer's vehicle. He said there was a struggle inside the car, and at some point Brown reached for the officer's weapon. One shot was fired inside the vehicle.

Brown suffered fatal gunshot wounds outside of the vehicle, approximately 35 feet from the car. Belmar said multiple shell casings were found at the scene, and that Brown was shot more than once, but an exact number of shots fired has not yet been determined. All the shell casings came from the officer's weapon.

Belmar confirmed Brown was unarmed at the time of the shooting. He did not say what led to the struggle inside the officer's car.

The medical examiner is conducting an investigation to determine how many times Brown was shot. It will take several weeks before toxicology results are available.

After the shooting, Belmar said Ferguson Chief Tom Jackson called him and asked the county to take over the investigation.

Belmar said when the investigation is complete the findings will be turned over to the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. They will determine if charges should be filed.

On Saturday afternoon the St. Louis County NAACP {called for the FBI to investigate}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/08/09/naacp-fbi-investigate-police-shooting/13845591/""> the shooting. Belmar said the FBI could become involved later, and that it's not unusual for the FBI to become involved in cases like this.

""My son just turned 18 and graduated from high school, and he don't bother nobody,"" Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told NewsChannel 5 Saturday night. She said he was looking forward to starting school at Vatterott College next week.

""They told me how many times my son was shot. Eight,"" said McSpadden. She said he was visiting his grandmother, who lives in the complex, and was returning from the store.

Sen. Claire McCaskill has released this statement in response to Michael Brown's death:

""As a mother, I grieve for this child and his family. I pray that the wonderful, hardworking, and God-loving people of Ferguson will find peace and patience as we wait for the results of what will be numerous and thorough investigations of what happened. I, like so many other Missourians, will not be satisfied until we have a complete and transparent understanding of all the facts and circumstances that led to this young man's death.""
Cornell Williams Brooks, president and CEO of NAACP, released this statement:

""Our prayers go out to the family and friends of 18-year-old Michael Brown of Ferguson, Missouri. The death of yet another African-American at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve the community where he lived is heartbreaking. Michael Brown was preparing to begin college, and now his family is preparing to bury their child – his life cut short in a tragic encounter with the police.
""As the NAACP's Missouri State Conference and St. Louis Branches seek answers about the circumstances surrounding Michael Brown's death, the National office will remain vigilant until accountability and justice are served for the countless individuals who lose their lives to misguided police practices throughout the country. Even as we call for accountability by those charged with protecting the community, we call on the community to act--collectively and calmly until we secure justice for the family of Michael Brown.""",81,9620,NA,NA
USAToday,usa29,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/17/missouri-brown-curfew-protests/14207423/,Clashes on second night of Ferguson curfew - USA Today,Yamiche Alcindor; Brandie Piper,08/18/2014,11/23/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Protests in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown continued Sunday as police for the second night imposed a curfew on this St. Louis suburb. Meanwhile, a preliminary autopsy found that Brown was shot at least six times, but the circumstances of his death remained unclear.

Late Sunday, more than two hours before a second midnight curfew was set to begin, police fired tear gas at hundreds of angry protesters who were marching down the town's main thoroughfare toward a police command center.

County police tweeted that protesters were throwing ""Molotov cocktails"" at police, but protesters, including Renita Lamkin, a pastor who has been acting as a peacekeeper, said no one threw Molotov cocktails. ""That is not true,"" she said. Meanwhile, a police announcer told the crowd, ""This is no longer a peaceful protest. You must leave the area.""

But protesters moving away from police faced a greater threat: gunshots coming from the other direction. It is unclear who fired the reported gunshots.

One protester, Keshonda James, 35, was driving away from police when a canister of tear gas shattered her windshield. The exploding glass hit her left arm, which was later bandaged by a fellow protester.

""Glass exploded everywhere. This isn't cool. I'm not down here looting,"" James said.

Late Sunday, The New York Times reported that a private autopsy requested by Brown's family found that he was shot at least six times, including four times in the right arm and twice in the head. All of the shots, the Times reported, were fired from Brown's front — a finding that could contradict a witness statement indicating that Brown was hit as he ran away from police.

Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family's request, the Times said. In an interview, he noted that one of the shots appeared to have struck Brown on the top of his head, but that it wasn't immediately clear what that signified. ""It can be because he's giving up, or because he's charging forward at the officer,"" Baden said.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declined Sunday to say when he expects the curfew to end or whether it would be extended further. ""We'd like to see it ratcheted down,"" Nixon said. ""What we'd like to see, that will be judged by the community."" Speaking on CNN, Nixon said he was ""heartened"" by the response to the curfew early Sunday.

At a rally Sunday afternoon, the civil rights attorney who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old shot to death in Sanford, Fla., in 2012., told a crowd that police are trying to assassinate Brown's character. On Friday, when police named Officer Darren Wilson as the officer who shot Brown, they also released a surveillance video that appears to show Brown stealing cigars from a convenience store and roughing up the clerk a few minutes before the fatal confrontation.

""They tried it with Trayvon, and now they are trying it with Michael,"" Benjamin Crump said. ""We know that this was an execution."" He noted that when the officer fired, witnesses say, Brown had his hands raised above his head. ""This means 'Surrender! Don't shoot!' And the most hardened criminals in history, when they put their hands up, we didn't execute them,"" Crump said.

Civil rights activist Al Sharpton told the crowd that protests would continue.

""We are not going to shut up,"" he said. ""We are going to come together and have a real peace.""

He told protesters not to loot in Brown's name. ""There's a difference between an activist and a thug,"" Sharpton said.

Donations for Brown's family poured in at the rally. Speakers announced that all three of Brown's siblings would receive full college scholarships. TV's Judge Greg Mathis announced that he would give the family $10,000. Sharpton said his National Action Network would pay for Brown's funeral. He encouraged others to give the family money. Donors filled several large baskets with cash. Sharpton said the money would go directly to the family.

He announced that a class-action lawsuit would be filed on behalf of Ferguson protesters who were tear-gassed while demonstrating and others who were injured. Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers for Justice and members of the New Black Panther Party have said they would file a lawsuit because they believe protesters' civil rights had been violated.

At the rally, Ron Johnson, the Missouri Highway Patrol captain at the head of security here, said protesters ""need to pray. We need to thank Mike for his life. We need to thank him for the change that he is going to make.""

Johnson told an animated crowd that Brown's violent death at the hands of police on Aug. 9 ""is going to make it for our sons so that they can be better black men. He's going to make it better for our daughters so they can be better black women, better for me so I can be a better black father. And we know they're going to make our mamas even better than they are today.""

Johnson, who is African-American and lives in nearby Florissant, told the crowd, ""This is my neighborhood. You are my family, you are my friends, and I am you. And I will stand and protect you. I will protect your right to protest.""

He said that when the protests are over, ""I'm going to go in my son's room — my black son, who wears his pants sagging, wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms — but that's my baby."" The crowd cheered loudly.

About 150 people rallied in downtown St. Louis on Sunday evening in support of Wilson, the officer who shot Brown. Passersby honked and cheered in support.

The Justice Department said Sunday that it would arrange for an independent autopsy of Brown's body ""due to the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family.""

The St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy concluded that Brown died of gunshot wounds, but other details have not been released.

During protests after the rally, 44-year-old LaDonna Hurd said she brought her two daughters Layla Green, 7, and Kentavia Taylor, 16, from their home in Belleville, Ill., about 25 minutes away.

""I feel like they need to be part of this,"" Hurd said. ""They need to know prejudices are still there.""

She said she brought her daughters to experience the protests firsthand because she wanted them to know that the struggles and issues that motivated Martin Luther King remain and must be challenged.

""I feel like in numbers we can get things done,"" she said. ""This is history.""",303,5984,NA,usa1gallery (same picture numbers)

Jay Nixon asked for patience and calm as another night of rioting following the shooting death in Ferguson of an unarmed black teenager descended into chaos.

The St. Louis suburb has been in turmoil since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot to death by a police officer on Saturday.  Nixon’s statement and announcement that he will be in North St. Louis County on Thursday came after the Democrat was criticized as missing in action as tensions escalated between protesters and Ferguson police.

The denunciation of Nixon comes as he is being mentioned as a possible presidential or vice presidential candidate on the 2016 Democratic ticket.

Nixon was elected to a second term in 2012 by 12 percentage points, even as President Obama lost Missouri — which has long been a bellwether in national politics.

Nixon helped fuel the speculation about 2016 when he said the Democratic field needs “a voice in the Heartland.” When Politico asked whether he could be that voice, the Missouri governor sidestepped. Earlier in the year, Nixon said he wouldn’t rule anything out.

The Missouri governor issued a statement as  tweets about Ferguson police responding to protesters with smoke bombs and tear gas went viral on Wednesday night. He called the situation “deeply troubling and does not represent who we are as Missourians or as Americans.”

National Guard ordered to Ferguson,Brandie Piper ,08/18/2014,11/23/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. - Gov. Jay Nixon signed an executive order early Monday morning directing the Missouri National Guard to Ferguson to restore order and to protect the citizens after protesters marched toward police Sunday night, throwing multiple Molotov cocktails at officers.

Under the direction of Col. Ron Replogle with the Missouri State Highway Patrol, the Guard will provide protection to the area, including the Unified Command Center, which was targeted Sunday evening.

""With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence, and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard,"" Nixon said.

Capt. Ron Johnson with the Missouri State Highway Patrol said what started as a calm evening of prayers and message of peace turned violent after dark, with protesters throwing Molotov cocktails, firing guns, and looting stores. He also said there were ""other acts of violence that appear to not have been spontaneous, but premeditated attacks designed to damage property, hurt people, and provoke a response.""

According to Johnson, the situation deteriorated quickly:

8:25 p.m. One person shot along West Florissant. Officers respond, more shots are fired and several Molotov cocktails are thrown at police. Vandals start looting nearby businesses, including Domino's Pizza, O'Reilly's Auto Parts, Family Dollar, and a self-storage business.
8:26 p.m. Shots are fired on Canfield.
8:27 p.m. Police receive a report for a person down.
8:28 p.m. Police receive a report for eight people with guns. Tactical teams are dispatched.
8:56 p.m. Hundreds of protesters march toward the police command post. In response, officers throw tear gas back at protesters and call for backup from area police departments.
9:20 p.m. A crowd gathers at the West Florissant McDonald's. Reports are made employees inside the restaurant sought safety by locking themselves inside a storage room.
Johnson went on to say more shots were fired and Molotov cocktails were thrown at officers. He says protesters also set up barricades in an attempt block police.

""For those who claimed the curfew is what led to tonight's violence, I will remind you it was these incidents that began before 8:30 p.m., three-and-a-half hours before the curfew was to have started last night,"" said Johnson.

I join the people of Ferguson, and all Missourians, in strongly condemning this criminal activity that included firing upon law enforcement officers, shooting a civilian, throwing Molotov cocktails, looting, and a coordinated attempt to block roads and overrun the Unified Command Center. These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory, and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served, and to feel safe in their own homes. Given these deliberate, coordinated and intensifying violent attacks on lives and property in Ferguson, I am directing the highly capable men and women of the Missouri National Guard to assist Colonel Ron Replogle and the Unified Command in restoring peace and order to this community.""
State Rep. Clem Smith (D-Velda Village Hills) disagrees with the deployment of the Guard, calling it ""unwarranted.""

""The deployment of the Missouri National Guard to Ferguson is an ill-advised escalation that could serve to make an already tense situation worse. As law enforcement officials themselves have said, the overwhelming majority of protestors are peaceful and law abiding, with a just a handful of troublemakers responsible for the problems that have occurred. It's hard to believe the actions of a few troublemakers warrant the use of military might.
""Addressing the grievances of those in our community who have been victims of police brutality, racial profiling, employment discrimination and institutional racism is the only way to bring calm to the area. Treating Ferguson as an occupied territory by placing tanks and armed soldiers on its streets is a huge leap in the opposite direction and will only further the distrust of government in my community.""",15,4791,NA,NA

Petitions on Change.org and White House website have called for a law that would require police to wear body cameras. At the time of the shooting, Ferguson police had no cameras near the incident.

""Many continue to speculate what happened, and we may never know the truth,"" Siefert writes in the petition. ""But one thing we know for sure is that the officer who killed him did not have a car dash camera or a body cam to record the incident -- a camera that could have prevented the incident or given us clear information about what happened.

Williams ,08/18/2014,11/23/2015,"ST. LOUIS COUNTY – The St. Louis NAACP is condemning the use of Missouri National Guard to bring peace and stability to the City of Ferguson.

The organization created a list of demands early Monday morning followed by a community meeting that addressed some of the group's concerns regarding the unrest in Ferguson.

Adolphus M. Pruitt, first vice president of Missouri State Conference of Branches and president of St. Louis NAACP, said that the NAACP is concerned with the confrontation of young black men coming face to face with those armed and serving in the military. Furthermore, he said that Captain Ronald Johnson, who was charged with Ferguson Security, and the Missouri Highway Patrol should be given more time to adjust.

He also called on forces to figure out more innovative means to protest peacefully.

The Missouri Highway Patrol took over security for Ferguson this past Thursday, following intense clashes between protesters and the St. Louis County Police.

Pruitt also called on the Department of Justice to expand its investigation to look at racial profiling for the entire St. Louis metropolitan area, including the Metro East region.

He's also asking for resources for those businesses hit hard by the unrest in Ferguson, and social services resource for those families who have been unable to get out of the Canfield Apartments, where unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson August 9.

Earlier in the morning, the St. Louis County NAACP requested a formal apology for Brown's family.

- For the Justice Department to take over the entire Brown investigation.
- The creation of citizen review boards for all municipal police departments to ensure transparency.
- A state investigation into each municipal police department in St. Louis County with histories of racial profiling and police brutality.
- The implementation of racial profile training for St. Louis County police officers.
- Periodic attorney general reports about racial profiling.

""We want the individuals that may appear to have a private agenda to cause disruption and chaos within the community to stop. We do not want peaceful protestors to appear that they are causing violence and rioting when incidents are being caused by a small group of individuals that are using this tragedy as an opportunity.

The tensions in Ferguson have sparked a debate about what critics say is the growing militarization of local police departments and the insensitivity of some police to residents. Some activists in Detroit have suggested ""that Detroit could be the next Ferguson,"" said Police Chief James Craig, a notion that he called ""appalling.""

""That's so far from the truth,"" Craig said.

""Our community is standing with us ... applauding the work we're doing today,"" he said.On Wednesday, Detroit police shot a suspect in the arm, injuring him, leading some at the scene to refer to Ferguson, where a teenager was shot dead by police Aug. 9. Over the past week, there have been three protests in the area of the shooting around Nottingham and Berkshire that were organized by the group BAMN (By Any Means Necessary). About 80 to 100 people attended a rally Saturday, said activist Leanna Mulholland.

The day before the Ferguson shooting, the U.S. Department of Justice and the city asked a judge to end federal oversight of the Detroit Police Department over police abuse. Ron Scott of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality is urging the Justice Department not to lift its 11-year consent decree.

In June, the American Civil Liberties Union released a report on the growing militarization of police departments across the U.S.; one example cited was the 2010 death in Detroit of 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley Jones, killed accidentally by a Detroit police officer during a SWAT raid that activists said was overzealous.

Activists have also criticized Detroit police for relying on paramilitary tactics during drug raids and other situations.

But Craig said Monday that in the ""nine large-scale operations in the city of Detroit in the 13 months"" during his tenure, the department has received only one complaint of excessive force.

""It illustrates the Detroit Police Department is a constitutional police department,"" he said.

Craig also defended his department's use of SWAT, SRT (special reaction team) and armored vehicles when dealing with drug raids, a shooter or barricaded suspect. Activists have said that police are relying too much on these teams and tools.

But Craig said that when police are dealing with ""fortified locations ... where there are heavy armaments, who better to send inside that location to execute a search warrant other than special response teams of SWAT units? We're not suggesting that we have tanks driving through neighborhoods. ... But when we have to address an active shooter situation or barricaded suspect, I think the community would applaud us coming in with an armored vehicle, not only to keep our officers safe, but to keep our community safe.""

In Ferguson, Brown's death led to protests that were met by a police reaction that critics said relied too much on militarized equipment and tactics.

Craig has worked in the police departments in Los Angeles and Cincinnati, which experienced rioting in 1992 and 2001. Craig was police chief in Cincinnati from 2011-13. He said the tensions in those areas — and in Detroit in 1967 — came about because police didn't have good relations with communities.

""The underlying issue is no relationship between a police department and that community,"" he said.",4,87,NA,first link doesn't work

Nearly a week after Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., the circumstances remain as murky as the nearby Mississippi River during a flood. Police and a Brown friend tell radically different stories about whether the shooting was justified or something closer to homicide.

It's too early for conclusions about the shooting. But the behavior of the Ferguson police department is another matter.

Its heavy handed, unprofessional tactics since the shooting raise grave doubts about both its competence and its credibility. It certainly cannot be trusted to investigate itself or, for that matter, to protect the community.

Police have enraged the public they serve by showing little respect for constitutional rights and little recognition of how Brown's killing has tapped into a deep vein of distrust of law enforcement among African Americans. By refusing to disclose basic information, including the name of the officer who shot Brown and autopsy results that could shed light on the case, they've needlessly raised suspicion.

Certainly, the officer and his family need protection, but a police department is fully capable of achieving that goal without resorting to stonewalling tactics that demolish public trust. After all, police and prosecutors routinely disclose names of arrested suspects, and in New York City, no stranger to this kind of controversy, it took only two days for police to {make public the name}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/19/nyc-chokehold-death-police/12881805/""> of the officer who allegedly killed a black suspect in July by putting him in an illegal chokehold.

The Ferguson police just appear clueless about race relations, for reasons with a familiar historical ring. Thirty years ago, the community was overwhelmingly white. Today, it is two-thirds black, but blacks still hold virtually no political power. The police force's 53-person roster includes just three African Americans. Black residents say they are frequently harassed, and their anger has fueled unrest — including looting and demonstrators throwing Molotov cocktails.

There's no excuse for that behavior. The vandals should be prosecuted. But neither does there seem to be any need for authorities to clear the streets with tear gas and rubber bullets, or to muster heavily armed SWAT teams with automatic weapons and armored trucks.

Pictures from Ferguson make the police look more like an occupying force fighting jihadis in Iraq than law enforcement keeping order in their own community. They seem intent on acting with impunity and blocking scrutiny.

Officers roughed up two reporters Wednesday, and video also shows police lobbing a tear gas grenade at a TV news crew. Once the crew fled, police in gas masks began taking down the lights and video camera — until they realized another crew was taping them. They've managed to cast themselves as a cross between Bull Connor, the iconic racist police chief of the segregation era, and the Keystone Cops.

Adult supervision began arriving Thursday. President Obama and Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon called for calm. They noted the rights of protesters and reporters. Nixon put the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of security.

Obama said he had asked the Justice Department and the FBI to conduct independent investigations of what happened to Michael Brown. That's reassuring.

Meanwhile, the police would help themselves with more transparency and less {militarization}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-michael-brown-militarization-column/14006383/"">.

Pasco told The Hill: ""I think what he has to do as president and as a constitutional lawyer is remember that there is a process in the United States and the process is being followed, for good or for ill, by the police and by the county and by the city and by the prosecutors' office.""

In calling for calm in Ferguson, Obama said:

""When something like this happens, the local authorities — including the police — have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death, and how they are protecting the people in their communities.

""There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.

""And here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.""

""'That is one where the president spoke precipitously without all the facts,' Pasco said, adding that the current situation 'is a much larger and more tragic incident.'

""Pasco said both police and members of the public are entitled to due process but said he is not convinced police have used excessive force in Ferguson.

USAToday,usa41,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/18/from-the-streets-of-ferguson/14260667/,"Voices: Firsthand fear, awe on Ferguson's tense streets", Yamiche Alcindor ,08/18/2014,11/24/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Protesters have clashed violently with police here, the looting and gunshots have terrified residents, and I have witnessed many things that don't fit neatly into stories about this community's prolonged period of unrest.

For me, the didn't-make-it-into-a-story notes are extensive. They sit crumpled up in the glove compartment of my rental car. Wet notebooks soaked by rain store stories about the looter who asked me if I needed help filming, the intimidating officer in riot gear who asked me if I needed a ride back to my car, and the peaceful protesters who guided me to the best spots to take cover while being tear-gassed.

Covering Ferguson's protests has been memorable, exhilarating and downright exhausting. I suspect many people — reporters, protesters, looters, law enforcement officials — are working on the same two to three hours of sleep I am getting.

Yet I don't want to sleep. This is too important.

I wake up every morning before sunrise worried that I have missed a development — a new autopsy report, a tragic shooting, President Obama commenting on the situation that I am living. Each night, I pray I can get home safely as I run from gunshots, tear gas and terrified, wildly swerving drivers fleeing the police.

And while at times this feels like a risky assignment, I've had moments that have defied the stereotypes of the dangerous looter and the menacing police officer.

There was the friendly looter who, after allowing me to film him carrying off large bottles of liquor, asked me a question that caught me off-guard. ""Got all you need, ma'am?"" he asked as he struggled to carry out his last bottle of stolen Grey Goose. I nodded yes.

Another looter, carrying bags of stolen food, offered to walk me back to my car as chaos erupted all around us and gunshots rang out.

All eyes are on Ferguson, Missouri as the National Guard takes some control and the federal government investigates the killing of Michael Brown. VPC

Then there was the officer, dressed in riot gear and holding plastic handcuffs, who, after hearing that I was parked more than a mile away, offered me a ride to my car.

My reporting has been aided by Good Samaritans. A woman who lives across the street from where Michael Brown died welcomed me into her home when I asked to use the bathroom. A group of praying women across from the Ferguson police station insisted on giving me my first meal of the day at 2 p.m. Sunday: water, chips and a doughnut.

But I've also had my share of scary moments. On Friday, as officers were asking protesters to leave, I sat in my car tweeting about the latest developments. When I looked up from my phone, I saw I was surrounded by officers holding rifles. ""Go home,"" they shouted as I sped off.

Others, I know, have had far worse experiences. On Sunday, a person was shot across the street from where I was standing. Two reporters say they were arrested because police decided they were not moving quickly enough from a McDonald's where they were working, and other journalists report being harassed by the police. I have watched as protesters have taunted, threatened and pushed journalists who were just trying to do their jobs.

The most important thing that I have encountered is a resilient group of people who are set on voicing their opinions. For them, Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a police officer Aug. 9, is not just a symbol but a personal reminder of the real discrimination people believe they face here.

I have watched mothers cry at the thought that Brown might have been their son. I have seen young men scream at the top of their lungs because they are convinced if things stay the way they are, they, too, could be shot by police. I have encountered a form of civil disobedience that asks us all to question the state of policing in America.

Ferguson is both what you think it is and so much more. Behind the protesting, the looting, the tear gas and the gunfire, there are real people finding ways to pleasantly interact.

In a Friday morning news conference Chief Thomas Jackson says the officer is Darren Wilson. Wilson is a six year veteran of the police force and Jackson never had disciplinary action while a member of the Ferguson department.

According to Jackson, the officer who killed Brown was at a sick call at 11:48 a.m. An ambulance was at the location of the sick call. At 11:51 a.m. Jackson says dispatchers received a 911 call about a robbery. One minute later police dispatch gave a description of the suspect.

Jackson also released information he said was requested under the Sunshine Law about a strong-armed robbery that occurred at a convenience store before Brown was killed. He said the convenience store that was robbed was not the {QuikTrip that was vandalized}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/11/ferguson-quiktrip-burned-down/13884675/""> and burned during {Sunday night's riot}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/08/10/rioting-breaks-out-in-ferguson/13880305/"">. Police also released security camera photographs from the convenience store robbery. The photos show a black male wearing a white shirt, shorts and red baseball cap involved in an alleged robbery.

Jackson says one officer arrived at the store, and more details were given over the radio, including that the suspect was walking toward QuikTrip.

He says Officer Wilson left the sick call and saw Brown walking on Canfield at 12:01 p.m. Jackson says a second officer arrived on Canfield at 12:04 p.m., after the shooting. One minute later Jackson says a supervisor arrived.

According to Jackson, the ambulance at the sick case arrived at Canfield and assessed Brown.

At the news conference, Jackson made no connection between the shooting of Michael Brown and the strong-armed robbery. However, the documents he released list Michael Brown and Dorian Johnson as suspects in that case.

Jackson says Wilson was treated for injuries sustained on Saturday.

Brown was unarmed when the officer killed him. Witnesses in the area say Brown had raised his hands to surrender when he was shot. Police have not confirmed that information.

In the released police report, Ferguson police state after viewing Brown's body and reviewing the surveillance video, they were able to confirm that Brown is the primary suspect in this incident. Police say a second person, also at the scene of the robbery, identified himself as being with Brown. That person was later identified as Dorian Johnson. The documents can be found below this story.

The name of the officer was scheduled to be released by Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson by 12 p.m. Tuesday, but he changed his mind, {citing social media threats}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/08/12/michael-brown-shooting-officer-name-delayed/13945205/""> made to officers.

May I assure the world that this is not the President of the Ethical Society of Police's Sergeant Darren R. Wilson who is African-American, and happens to be an 18 year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department.
I'm sure additional clarification statements will be released immediately.
Thank you for your continued support.
Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing the family of Michael Brown, released the following statement on his Facebook page on behalf of the family:

""Michael Brown's family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piece mil information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.

There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.
The prolonged release of the officer's name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies.
It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him.
The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, from being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael's death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.""

Rapper and St. Louis native Nelly went to Ferguson on Monday to talk to protesters as another night of chaos and clashing led to more arrests. He recently announced that he had set up a scholarship fund in Michael Brown’s name. He and T.I. both told TMZ the violence escalated too quickly.

“I understand the frustration, but we have to strategize before we overreact,” said Nelly.

Diddy, in an Instagram video, called on President Obama to get involved, saying, “Obama, get on a plane. This is serious. These are your people, baby.”

J.Cole also visited Ferguson and was moved to write a song, Be Free, saying, “I’m tired of being desensitized to the murder of black men.”

What was supposed to be a peaceful protest and prayer vigil turned volatile, with stores being looted and vandalized throughout the area, and shots being fired into the air.

A group of protesters marched from the Canfield Green apartment complex, where 18-year-old Michael Brown {was shot to death}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2014/08/10/ferguson-police-news-conference-michael-brown/13860601/""> Saturday afternoon by a Ferguson police officer, to the Quiktrip store in the 9400 block of West Florissant.

The protesters smashed glass at the store, looted it, vandalized the walls with graffiti, and set it on fire.

Firefighters were able to extinguish the fire, but as of early Monday morning it was still smoking.

Mike Thornbrough, a spokesperson for Quiktrip, says three stores in north St. Louis County in close proximity to the 9400 W. Florissant location were temporarily closed for a short period of time Sunday night into Monday morning as a precaution.

Thornbrough says the stores are now open for business as usual.

MLK knew preventing riots means recognizing common humanity, ending brutality.

Like many fellow citizens I have watched the developments in Ferguson, Missouri, with a sense of deep sorrow and shame. Sorrow at the loss of yet another black youth, shame that I feel helpless to do much about it.

I know that I am not alone.

Indeed, when our greatest peacemaker, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was confronted with what to do about the 1967 riots in {Newark}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11966375""> and {Detroit}<hyperlink=""http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-12th-street-riot"">, he too felt helpless.

Dr. King knew all too well the abject poverty that had long plagued these cities. Rampant unemployment, racial profiling, police brutality, substandard housing, stunted educational opportunities and political disenfranchisement had been {wracking these cities}<hyperlink=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/story/13_detroit.html""> for years. Newark and Detroit were smoldering {tinderboxes}<hyperlink=""http://www.pbs.org/pov/revolution67/background.php"">, and rage had overpowered reason.

To those who would listen, Dr. King condemned the riots while pointing to the corrosive conditions that created them. In a {telegram}<hyperlink=""http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/king/telegram-7-25-67.html""> to President Lyndon Johnson, King said, ""Though the aimless violence and destruction may be contained through military means, only drastic changes in the life of the poor will provide the kind of order and stability you desire. There is no question that the violence and destruction of property must be halted, but Congress has consistently refused to vote a halt to the destruction of the lives of Negroes in the ghetto.""

Sound familiar?

King goes on in the telegram to lament the rejection of congressional legislation that could benefit the nation's urban poor, and he lays out {a plan to}<hyperlink=""http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/king/telegram-7-25-67.html""> ""end unemployment totally and immediately…If our government cannot create jobs, it cannot govern. It cannot have white affluence amid black poverty and have racial harmony. The turmoil of the ghetto is the externalization of the Negro's inner torment and rage.""

The press, though, were far more interested in headlining the reactions of the protesters.

Sound familiar?

Dr. King struggled with how to juxtapose his public pronouncements with his private pain. He felt helpless and ultimately decided not to travel to Detroit to help stop the ongoing riots because {he felt the trip would be futile}<hyperlink=""http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/mlk-press-conference-regarding-telegram-president-johnson"">. ""I feel that my job is to try to work in communities to build the programs and to try to bring about the response from administrations that will prevent riots.""

I turned on the television Sunday night to see that the police had once again {fired tear gas}<hyperlink=""http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/mlk-press-conference-regarding-telegram-president-johnson""> on the protesters, and to learn that an independent autopsy requested by the family of Michael Brown found that he had been {shot six times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?_r=1"">, twice in the head. Just the kind of ""breaking news"" you don't want to hear when you're trying to quell a riot.

I have no idea where this story is headed in the coming days, weeks and months. Sadly, I do know where America is headed if we don't come to recognize that these {killings of black youth}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/14/michael-brown-police-shooting-ferguson/14085601/""> are really much less about black and white or even wrong and right, and more about our society's incessant contestation of the dignity and humanity of too many fellow citizens.

So, what to do about our individual and collective sense of helplessness and hopelessness?

In truth, there's really no need to feel helpless or hopeless if we're willing to do the work to make America a nation as good as its promise. But the hard work has to be done. What kind of nation do we really want to be? What kind of people are we really? Do we really think it's right that a town like Ferguson which is {67 percent black}<hyperlink=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/12/5994181/ferguson-is-67-percent-black-and-its-police-force-is-94-percent-white""> should be under {white political rule}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/opinion/in-ferguson-black-town-white-power.html"">?

It also has made Ferguson the nation's latest epicenter of racial conflict.

""Trayvon Martin was shot once. He was murdered at night by a {wannabe cop}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/05/us/trayvon-martin-shooting-fast-facts/"">,"" Crump said. ""Brown was shot {multiple times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-missouri-town-under-siege-after-police-shooting.html""> in the middle of a street, in broad daylight, as he held his hands in the air in the universal symbol of surrender.""

Police offer a different explanation for Brown's death. They say {Darren Wilson}<hyperlink=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html"">, a white, six-year police veteran, shot Brown in self-defense. But, Crump said, ""Several witnesses are telling federal investigators amazingly consistent stories of how Brown was shot as he held his hands in the air."" So far, the {U.S. Department of Justice}<hyperlink=""http://fox2now.com/2014/08/15/fbi-agents-in-ferguson-looking-for-more-witnesses-in-michael-browns-death/""> has only said that the FBI has ""conducted several interviews of witnesses on the scene at the time of the shooting.""

Uncovering the truth of what happened to Brown won't be easy. But the damage done by the handling of this situation by those who are supposed to enforce the law will be infinitely harder to undo.

Ferguson's police chief, Thomas Jackson, seems more intent on absolving Wilson of blame than discovering what actually caused him to take Brown's life. Without even the pretense of a full investigation, Jackson announced that Brown attacked Wilson, pushing him back into his patrol car and struck him in the face during a {struggle for his gun}<hyperlink=""http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Chief-Officer-in-fatal-shooting-suffered-facial-injuries-271079471.html"">.

How the police chief was able to speak with such certainty about what provoked Wilson to shoot Brown several times, but unable to answer the charge that his officer gunned down Brown as he held his hands in the air to surrender, suggests that Jackson is in the wrong job. He ought to be the town's Fraternal Order of Police president, not its top cop.

This became even more apparent when Jackson — {after days of delay}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/""> — finally identified Wilson as Brown's killer. At the same time, the police chief released a {surveillance video}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/""> that allegedly shows Brown stealing some cigars from a neighborhood store minutes before his deadly encounter with the cop.

Unless summary execution is the penalty for such a petty crime in Ferguson, the only relevance this video could serve would be to make Brown a less sympathetic victim for the prosecutor or grand jury that likely will decide whether the officer will be charged with a crime. An {autopsy}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html""> done at the request of Brown's family by Michael Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, concluded that the teenager was shot at least six times.

""What could (Brown) possibly have done to be executed like that?"" Crump asked, as he ended our call without waiting for an answer.

Chief Tom Jackson spoke to media Friday afternoon, hours after he identified {Officer Darren Wilson, 28, as the shooter}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/08/15/michael-brown-ferguson-officer-name-release/14097589/""> and released surveillance video of the robbery.

Eighteen-year-old Michael Brown was suspected of taking a $48.99 box of cigars from the store in what police described as a ""strong-arm robbery."" Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was an eyewitness to the shooting, admitted Friday via his attorney that the {pair were involved in the robbery}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/08/15/attorney-dorian-johnson-michael-brown-robbery/14118769/"">. Chief Jackson said investigators determined Johnson was not complicit in a crime and thus will not face any charges.

""We've pretty much given you every bit of information we have,"" he said.

Jackson said police have had the surveillance tape for a while, but kept it out of the public eye because they had to see if anybody would be charged. When asked why he opted to make the tape public at the same time he released the officer's name, Chief Jackson said his department had received many Sunshine Law requests for the tape and that police no longer had good cause to keep it under wraps.

The chief said it was not prudent to release the surveillance tape without releasing the name of the officer involved in the shooting.

When asked about the possibility that it was not Brown on the surveillance tape committing the robbery, Jackson implored skeptics to review the tape. Meanwhile, {Michael Brown's family issued its own statement}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/08/15/michael-brown-family-statement-ferguson-shooting/14120891/""> Friday to express outrage over the decision to release the video.

Brown was shot and killed August 9 while walking back to his grandmother's house. He was unarmed. Witnesses to the shooting said Brown raised his hands to surrender when he was shot. Police have not confirmed that information.

Wilson, a six-year police veteran, stopped Brown and Johnson because the two were walking in the middle of the street and blocking traffic, Chief Jackson said. Wilson was unaware the pair were wanted in connection with the robbery; another officer was investigating the robbery at the time.

At a news conference Friday morning, Jackson said the officer who killed Brown was at a sick call at 11:48 a.m. and an ambulance was at the location of the sick call. At 11:51 a.m., Jackson said dispatchers received a 911 call about a robbery. One minute later, police dispatch gave a description of the suspect.

Jackson would not discuss any measures being taken for Wilson's security, but described the officer as a ""gentleman"" and ""distinguished officer.""

That's why two members of Cincinnati Black United Front, an organization that signed onto the agreement, have been in Ferguson this weekend distributing hundreds of copies of the historic pact.

""We're here to share Cincinnati's story of struggle and success,"" said the Rev. Damon Lynch III, pastor of New Prospect Baptist Church, Roselawn, and former president of Cincinnati Black United Front. ""We want to offer a way forward, from riots to reform.""

The predominately black St. Louis suburb faced a second night of a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew overnight Sunday. Put in place by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, the curfew is intended to quiet unrest since the Aug. 9 fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, 18, an unarmed African-American, by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

Lynch and fellow Black United Front member Iris Roley, a Bond Hill business owner, attended a rally Sunday afternoon at Greater Grace Church in Ferguson. Brown's parents did not speak, but Martin Luther King III and the Rev. Al Sharpton, president and founder of the National Action Network, did speak. ""These parents, they're not crying alone,"" Sharpton said. ""We have had enough.""

""The church was filled to capacity,"" said Lynch, who met with several clergy and civil-rights leaders throughout the day Sunday, giving them copies of the collaborative agreement. ""My message is that Cincinnati hammered out an agreement that made the city better.""

Over-the-Rhine and nearby black neighborhoods erupted in violence following the April 7, 2001, police shooting of an unarmed black man, Timothy Thomas, who had a record of minor criminal offenses and was running away from police.

In March 2001, a month before the riots, the American Civil Liberties Union and local groups joined a 1999 lawsuit, filed by Bomani Tyehimba, that claimed police had discriminated against black people in Cincinnati for decades. That lawsuit led to the collaborative agreement in 2002 among the {ACLU}<hyperlink=""http://enquirer.com/editions/2002/04/13/loc_1settlement_signed.html"">, {Cincinnati Black United Front}<hyperlink=""http://enquirer.com/editions/2002/04/13/loc_1settlement_signed.html"">, {city of Cincinnati}<hyperlink=""http://enquirer.com/editions/2002/04/13/loc_1settlement_signed.html""> and {Fraternal Order of Police}<hyperlink=""http://enquirer.com/editions/2002/04/09/loc_police_union_oks.html"">, the police union. A memorandum of understanding, a deal signed with the U.S. Department of Justice, required many more concrete reforms, including in the way uses of police force are recorded and tracked. U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott appointed a federal monitor, who oversaw compliance for the next six years.

Other reforms included:

• Training officers in low-light situations, like the alley where Thomas died, and in dealing with suspects with mental health problems.

• Training in how to recognize possible mental health issues in suspects and to better handle mentally ill people.

• Putting computers in officers' cruisers to give them access to a person's detailed criminal record.

• Changing the foot-pursuit policy to require that officers assess whether a pursuit is appropriate, taking into consideration the seriousness of the offense, whether the suspect is armed and their ability to apprehend the suspect at a later date.

""We didn't realize it at the time, but we accomplished something historic,"" said Lynch, who added that Ferguson's black community is not as well organized as Cincinnati's was before the Thomas shooting. Black United Front was founded in July 2000 to protest the closing of Downtown restaurants during such African-American events as what is now known as the Macy's Music Festival.

""We went from the restaurant closings to the boycott to the lawsuit to the collaborative,"" Lynch said. ""It was seamless. What they're facing here in Ferguson, it's a lot more challenging.""

Lynch led a boycott of Downtown that caused several African-American conventions and entertainers – including Bill Cosby, Wynton Marsalis, the O'Jays and Temptations – to cancel shows.

The National Urban League Conference returned to Cincinnati in July after canceling its scheduled convention in Cincinnati in 2003.

A statement issued by the Ferguson police department expressed sympathy over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown on Saturday, saying ""police are working to restore confidence in the safety of our community and our neighborhoods so that we may begin the healing process.""

The statement said the city and police department ""have heard the community's cries for justice"" and pledged to cooperate fully with local and federal investigations into the fatal shooting.

""We ask that any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner,"" the statement said. ""We further ask all those wishing to demonstrate or assemble to disperse well before the evening hours to ensure the safety of the participants and the safety of our community.""

It said that some individuals had co-opted peaceful protests during the past three nights and turned them into violent demonstrations.

Brown was shot and killed on Saturday. Dorian Johnson, who was standing beside the victim at the time, told KSDK-TV that Brown was shot in the head and chest while holding his hands up and facing the police officer who had stopped them on the street.

On Sunday, a protest deteriorated into chaos, with angry mobs smashing windows and looting businesses. Police have used tear gas on at least two nights to control crowds in this town of 21,000 people.

The official statement is being reposted in its entirety:

The City of Ferguson mourns the loss of Michael Brown's life that occurred this past Saturday. We understand members of our community, and those nationwide, are grieving with us. We have worked diligently to provide an opportunity for our residents to both grieve and voice frustrations through prayer vigils and peaceful protests.
We would like to extend our gratitude to the St. Louis County Police Department, the St. Louis City Police Department, the Missouri Highway Patrol, and numerous local law enforcement agencies for their assistance over the past several days. These officers have worked throughout the night to quell violent outbursts and restore calm to our City.
We are working to restore confidence in the safety of our community and our neighborhoods so that we may begin the healing process. We have heard the community's cries for justice and assure the public that the Ferguson Police Department will continue to cooperate fully in the investigations led by the St. Louis County Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Justice Department.
We ask that any groups wishing to assemble in prayer or in protest do so only during daylight hours in an organized and respectful manner. We further ask all those wishing to demonstrate or assemble to disperse well before the evening hours to ensure the safety of the participants and the safety of our community. Unfortunately, those who wish to co-opt peaceful protests and turn them into violent demonstrations have been able to do so over the past several days during the evening hours. These events are not indicative of the City of Ferguson and its residents.
The City of Ferguson has been through tough situations in the past, albeit nothing to this magnitude, but will continue to display resilience and fortitude. The Mayor and City Council are committed to taking the necessary steps to rebuild and strengthen our community. We look forward to your cooperation and support.",0,101,NA,NA

LOUIS — Twitter on Thursday suspended an account linked to a loose-knit ""hacktivist"" group that released the name of a police officer it says shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.

Police, Ferguson's mayor and the stepmother of the man named all say the group is incorrect and that the person named is not a police officer.

Kathie Warnack, 48, started quietly crying when she learned that Anonymous had released the name of her stepson.

The St. Louis resident said her stepson is a 32-year-old police dispatcher in St. Ann, Mo., and before that a manager at a dollar store. He has never worked as a police officer — not in Ferguson or anywhere else, she said.

Her stepson also doesn't live at the address released by the group and rarely comes over, Warnack said.

""Wow, this is not good,"" said Warnack, as she began to cry on the steps of her home, which sits along a busy road.

""I guess I'm going to have to sleep with my gun and put cameras on the house,"" she said. ""Now I have to defend myself and I didn't do anything wrong.""

Warnack is disabled by a birth defect that means she has an artificial left leg and less than five misshapen fingers on each hand.

She said she has a small gun to protect herself, but has never used it.

Warnack added that she'll also rely on her four dogs — two German shepherds and two corgi. She's lived in her home for 18 years and shares it with her brother, sister-in-law and another stepson.

""Anonymous has really gotten out of hand,"" she said, her hand covering her mouth in disbelief. ""As soon as you leave here, I'm going to try to call him (her stepson) at work and tell him what happened.""

Warnack also said she planned to call her friends — some of whom are police officers — to warn them that her address ""got hit.""

Her biggest worry: ""Just not knowing if someone could come by here,"" she said. ""I've been watching everything unfold on the news and it's scary.""

ANONYMOUS TWEET

On Thursday, the @TheAnonMessage account released the name of a person it said was the officer involved in the shooting. That comment was later suspended.

Twitter says it does not comment on individual accounts, but did point to its {rules}<hyperlink=""https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules"">. Those state that users may not ""publish or post other people's private and confidential information"" and may not ""publish or post direct, specific threats of violence against others.""

There is no one Anonymous group but rather several individuals who make statements and take action under the broad umbrella of the name.

Their YouTube videos often include a stylized image of a black and white suit with a question mark where the head should be. The voice overs are done using computer software, giving them an eerie tone.

They often use the tag line, ""We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.""

GUY FAWKES IMAGE

In public protests, those representing themselves as Anonymous often wear Guy Fawkes masks. Fawkes was an English Catholic who participated in a plot to overthrow King James I and put a Catholic back on the English throne in 1605. The plot failed and Fawkes was condemned to death.

In recent years, Fawkes has been taken up as an icon by some anarchist groups, in part because of the use of a Guy Fawkes mask by the central character in the graphic novel ""V for Vendetta"" by Alan Moore and the subsequent movie.

In general, the decentralized collection of Internet savvy activists believe in freedom and and end to censorship. It supported the Occupy movement in the United States.

Someone claiming to be the group posted a {video}<hyperlink=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75WkEZK_f6g""> on YouTube on Monday.

Dorian Johnson said he was standing inches from Brown when the shooting occurred around 1:40 p.m. Saturday. He gave his account of the shooting to KSDK-TV.

""The officer is approaching us and as he pulled up on the side of us, he didn't say freeze, halt or anything like we were committing a crime. He said, 'Get the F on the sidewalk.'

After Johnson said the officer thrust open the door of his patrol car, hitting the pair, Johnson said the officer grabbed Brown around the neck and tried to pull him through the window. He said Brown never tried to reach for the officer's weapon.

""The second time he says, 'I'll shoot,' a second later the gun went off and he let go,"" Johnson said. ""That's how we were able to run at the same time. The first car I see, I ducked behind for because I fear for my life. I'm scared. I don't know what's going on. I don't understand why this officer is shooting his weapon at us.""

According to Johnson, the officer pursued Brown and fired another shot. which struck Brown in the back. He said Brown turned and faced the officer with his hands raised.

""My friend started to tell the officer that he was unarmed and that he could stop shooting (him),"" Johnson said. ""Before he could get his second sentence out, the officer fired several more shots into his head and chest area. He fell dramatically into the fatal position. I did not hear once he yell freeze, stop or halt. it was just horrible to watch.""

Johnson said he could tell Brown was in pain after the shooting.

""It hurt him a lot,"" he said. ""I could see it in his eyes. It was definitely like being shot like an animal.

""I definitely think (the officer) is guilty of murder.""

Johnson, who is expected to be interviewed by the FBI Wednesday, said he moved from his apartment with his girlfriend and young daughter because he feared retaliation from police.

""I left because I feared that if I stayed, something would happen to me. I felt like if they would have gotten me, they would have done anything possible to make sure I couldn't come forth and give my side of what happened.""

On Tuesday, about a mile away from where the shooting took place, protests erupted for the third night in a row in Ferguson, but were largely peaceful, with several young pulling their shirts up to cover their faces.

A confrontation with police ended with police once again firing tear gas into the crowd. Police said they were responding to protesters who had thrown bottles at officers, according to CNN.

Tensions increased in the community on Tuesday when authorities, backing down on an earlier promise to to release the name of the white police officer who killed the unarmed Brown.

The lack of a recording raises questions as to whether law enforcement interaction should always be on video — and if cops should wear cameras themselves.

Ferguson police cars do not have dash cameras, although their use has become widespread in the U.S. In Springfield, patrol cars are equipped with dash cams. Chief Paul Williams said the cameras' presence is ""overwhelmingly positive.""

Dash cams have benefited officers by allowing quicker resolution to complaints, Williams said. Video reveals accusations against officers to be false far more often than it shows police misconduct, he said.

However, a growing number of police departments are moving beyond dash cams — which typically have a limited, fixed perspective — to wearable cameras that record what an individual officer sees and hears.

Taser International, a leading manufacturer of police body cams, did not respond to a request for comment. But the company {told The New York Times}<hyperlink=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/business/wearable-video-cameras-for-police-officers.html?pagewanted=all""> in April 2013 that it has received orders from departments in Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City and Hartford, Conn., as well as Fort Worth, Texas, and Chesapeake, Va.
In Rialto, Calif., officers were given body cams as part of an experiment conducted in conjunction with a Cambridge University researcher. The study, released last year, found that the use of force among officers declined compared with those who did not wear the cameras. Officers without cameras experienced twice as many incidents of use of force, according to the report.

Officers, when they did use force, were more likely to use tasers when recorded. In the experiment, no officer who used force was responsible for initiating physical contact when recorded, but officers initiated contact four times when not recorded.

Complaints against officers also plunged, from 28 in the year before the experiment to just three during the trial.

Springfield police have not used body cams widely, but Williams said it is the ""wave of the future."" He said the decision whether to use body cams is his, though the primary obstacle is cost. Cameras can run upwards of $400 each.

""We've fielded tested over the last five years three or four different brands. Haven't made a decision to go in that direction yet, mainly because there's cost involved,"" Williams said.

Mike Evans, president of the Springfield Police Officers Association, said the organization does not have a position either way on the use of body cams. Cameras capture evidence both good and bad, Evans said.

If police get body cams, Williams wants to continue to use dash cams. Dash cams have their own advantages over body cams, such as recording how a scene appears as officers roll up in a patrol car, Williams said.

Privacy concerns

Though police body cams are designed to promote transparency and officer accountability, the idea of a law enforcement official silently recording every citizen interaction has also raised privacy concerns.

Jay Stanley, a policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union, {acknowledged the apprehension}<hyperlink=""https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/police_body-mounted_cameras.pdf""> in an October report, but ultimately came down in favor of the cameras.

""Although we generally take a dim view of the proliferation of surveillance cameras in American life, police on-body cameras are different because of their potential to serve as a check against the abuse of power by police officers,"" Stanley wrote. ""Historically, there was no documentary evidence of most encounters between police officers and the public, and due to the volatile nature of those encounters, this often resulted in radically divergent accounts of incidents.""

Stanley said the ACLU generally regards cameras to be a good thing when they function to allow public monitoring of government instead of the other way around.

Williams said officers now expect citizens to take photos and video of them and that body cams have gained acceptance more quickly than previous police technology, leading to a fast pace of adoption throughout the country.

A year-long Cambridge University study conducted at the Rialto, Calif., Police Department of officers’ use of video cameras showed an 88% reduction in citizen complaints and 60% reduction in use of force, Taser says. Earlier this week, New York federal judge Shira Scheindlin declared that the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk program was unconstitutional and ordered some NYPD precincts to start using video cameras, saying they would reduce potential constitutional rights violations.

Taser is best known for its stun guns, which still account for the lion’s share of revenue.

For the quarter ended June 30, Taser said stun guns accounted for $32.7 million of $37.2 million in overall sales. But video equipment revenue surged 136% to $4.5 million from the year ago quarter and orders jumped 465% to $11 million from $2 million in the year-ago quarter.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The market's attorney says it has been in the Ferguson community for many years and is the type of place where customers and employees all know one another. Friday, the market's attorney said the owners intend to keep it that way.

Former Ferguson resident Shaneis Hubbard used to work just a couple of doors down from the market and would visit it almost every day. She stopped by Friday to see for herself what the market would say about the surveillance video that allegedly caught Michael Brown stealing from the store, not long before he was killed.

""Regardless of the petty crime he was allegedly involved in, nobody deserves to be gunned down like that, nobody; white, black, other, nobody,"" she said.

The store's owners, through their attorney, sent the message that they want to stay as far away from the situation as possible. In fact, he said, even after the initial alleged theft, it was a customer who called police.

""It's not about them. They didn't call the police, they didn't ask the police to come and take the video,"" said attorney Jay Kanzler.

Now, the Ferguson Market owners are hoping the video won't make them a target.

""They would hope that the people of this community, who have consistently supported them, would continue to support them, and realize that whatever the police are looking at on the surveillance tapes has nothing to with what went on in the streets,"" said Kanzler.",17,4103,NA,NA

(KSDK) -- The surreal experience of watching looting and vandalism on live television is exacting a very real price for local businesses in Ferguson. Instead of preparing for a day of business with customers, the owners and employees of a Ferguson beauty supply store are now cleaning up, boarding up and preparing to close, at least temporarily.

Benny Billups does small maintenance repairs for the owners of the Feel Beauty Supply store. He said looters entered by shattering a glass door and ransacked the store. ""They tried to get into the cash register, stole hair items and some jewelry, said Billups. ""I'm just frustrated because these people are not understanding how this affects others when they come with this foolishness. There was a tragedy, yes, but this not how you deal with a tragedy.""

The store had been closed earlier this week following the initial unrest spurred by the death of 18 year old Michael Brown, a black teenager, at the hands of a white police officer. The store reopened Thursday,

The employees on the scene said their jobs at Feel are mostly part time, but are an important part of their income. They say the damage will require the store to close, for now. ""I'm crushed,"" said one store employee. ""This is my living! I have to take care of my family. This is not good. It's not fair. People are not looking at this as a positive thing, they're looking at it as a rage, and it's not about raging. Raging gets you nowhere.""

Tanya Littleton is the manager of Feel, she said the store will have to shut down. ""It's not worth it,"" said Littleton. ""Right now our safety is more important than anything.' Littleton doesn't know if Feel Beauty Supply will ever open again. She says the owners are scared for their lives and simply want out.",8,276,NA,NA

Paul on Ferguson: 'Impossible' for blacks not to feel targeted,Catalina Camia ,08/14/2014,12/08/2015,"Sen. Rand Paul, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, is calling for the demilitarization of police amid angry protests in a St. Louis suburb over the shooting of an unarmed black teenager.

Paul, a Kentucky Republican, writes in an {op-ed column}<hyperlink=""http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/""> for Time magazine that the {actions by police in Ferguson, Mo.}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/ferguson-missouri-police-clashes-shooting-anonymous/14046707/"">, since Michael Brown was shot to death “resemble war more than traditional police action.” He also argues that race is a factor in how criminal justice is applied, making the militarization of police in cities such as Ferguson an even bigger problem.

From his column for Time, posted online Thursday:

Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.

Paul’s comments stand out because he is a Tea Party favorite and a Republican who has made outreach to blacks a priority. He is teaming with Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey on a bill to overhaul the nation’s sentencing laws and criminal justice system.

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., also called for demilitarizing the unrest in Ferguson.

“We need to demilitarize this situation — this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution. I obviously respect law enforcement’s work to provide public safety, but my constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect that right and protect that right,” McCaskill said.

Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., meanwhile, said he will introduce legislation to curb a Pentagon program that provides guns and other {surplus military equipment}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/15/local-law-enforcement-agencies-surplus-military-equipment/10286485/""> to police departments free of charge.

Crowds became unruly at a vigil for an unarmed black man who was shot and killed by police.

People smashed car windows and carried away armloads of looted goods from stores in Ferguson and Dellwood after the vigil for Michael Brown, 18, who died Saturday after being shot multiple times by a Ferguson police officer.

Among other businesses, a QuikTrip convenience store and a nearby liquor store were damaged and looted. A fire was set behind the liquor store, according to reporters on the scene. There were multiple reports of gunfire.

Alderman Antonio French of the 21st Ward in St. Louis, posted several Vine videos on Twitter Sunday night showing looters smashing windows and carrying off goods. A little after midnight he tweeted that the looting had spread to neighboring Dellwood.

Ferguson police called in an extra 60 officers as well as police from all surrounding jurisdictions. St. Louis city police were assisting by answering calls in St. Louis County, and a St. Louis SWAT team was staging.

Around 8 p.m. Central Time, people began gathering at the scene where the shooting occurred. One group of young men broke off to spray paint ""R.I.P. Michael"" on the street, and others placed candles, flowers and a teddy bear at the exact location where Brown was killed.

Earlier in the day, shouts of ""No justice, no peace"" and ""We want answers"" nearly drowned out a news conference as St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar detailed the shooting.

It began with an altercation involving two men and the officer around noon Saturday, Belmar said. One of the men pushed the officer into his patrol car, there was a scuffle inside the car over the officer's gun, and the officer fired one shot inside the cruiser.

Seconds later, outside the cruiser, he fired several more shots and 18-year-old Michael Brown lay dead.

Brown was unarmed, and all the shell casings found on the ground were from the officer's gun, Belmar said.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said Sunday she doesn't understand why police didn't subdue her son with a club or Taser. She said police have not explained why the officer confronted him.

""I would like to see him fired,"" McSpadden said. ""I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty.""

""My son just turned 18 and graduated from high school, and he don't bother nobody,"" she said Saturday night. She said he was looking forward to starting at Vatterott College next week.

""They told me how many times my son was shot. Eight,"" McSpadden said.

She said he was visiting his grandmother, who lives in the complex in a predominantly black suburb of the city, and was returning from the store.

The St. Louis County NAACP has called for an FBI investigation and Belmar has contacted the FBI.

John Gaskin, with the St. Louis County NAACP, alluded to the racially charged 2012 shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder, and the death of a New York man from a police chokehold after he was confronted on suspicion of selling individual cigarettes.

""With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers … this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization,"" Gaskin said.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said police are in contact with the second person who was involved in the altercation. Authorities aren't sure if the second person was unarmed, Jackson said.

Belmar said that when the investigation is complete, the findings will be turned over to the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.



The identity of the officer who shot Brown has not been disclosed by police. He has been with the Ferguson Police Department for about six years, Belmar said. He was put on paid administrative leave and was being interviewed by investigators. Jackson told Belmar the officer will undergo two psychological evaluations if it is determined he can return to active duty.

The St. Louis County Police Department said Ferguson police cars do not have dash cameras and there is no surveillance video at the apartment complex where the shooting occurred.

St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted Sunday saying he stands with County Executive Charlie Dooley in his call ""for a full and open inquiry into yesterday's shooting in Ferguson.""

Outside the Ferguson Police Department's headquarters Sunday morning protesters raised their hands in the air and chanted, ""Don't shoot.""

On Saturday, witnesses said Brown had raised his hands in the air before he was shot, but that was not confirmed by Belmar.

Protesters called for 10,000 people to join them at 10 a.m. Monday at the Ferguson Police Department. The crowd marched through the streets Sunday morning and afternoon.

The Rev. Al Sharpton says the shooting death of Brown is ""very disturbing,"" and the civil-rights leader is planning a visit to Ferguson to make that known.

Sharpton tells The Associated Press that he's spoken with a grandfather of Michael Brown and plans to meet with the family in person Monday night or Tuesday in Ferguson.

No one is speaking about looting or rioting being ok the protesters did what was right they stood in front of the rioters. Peaceful protest is absolutely the right thing to do I said curfew can escalate the situation where more people could potentially rebel. If that happens now law enforcement would be forced to use force if necessary I feel the community did a good job by standing their ground & saying no this isn't the way destroy private property I don't condone that neither do I condone black kids being murdered for a petty crime. I have a 16 year old daughter and nieces,nephews and cousins and if they made a foolish mistake and stole cigars I don't want them shot!!!!! No race or family deserves to deal with that let's talk about why the riots happen not saying it's right but let's look at the big picture.
I'm not just a ball player I'm a person and I'm speaking my opinion on My page if you don't like it then get off My page period!

But reports and images that ordinary {people shared on social media}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/14/social-media-ferguson-effect/14052495/> have played a huge role in widening outrage and calls for action, particularly among young African-Americans who say Brown's killing is representative of their position in American society.

Beacon says the campaign can keep journalists on the ground — even after the national media have packed up and go home.

""There are eyewitnesses on the ground who can share their experiences, and people who can trace the shooting's aftermath and impact on the community,"" says the site.

The campaign is currently funding three journalists, including freelancer Peter Tinti, a journalist who has written frequently about Africa for the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and others.

African Americans are killed by white police officers nearly twice a week in the United States, according to the most recent accounts of justifiable homicide reported to the FBI during a seven-year period ending in 2012.

On average, there were 96 incidents among at least 400 police killings each year that were reported to the FBI by local police, USA TODAY found. The reports show that 18% of blacks killed during those seven years were under age 21, compared to 8.7% of whites.

The letter, published Monday, comes from Fulton's experience in 2012 when her 17-year-old son Trayvon was shot by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, 28, in Florida.

Zimmerman was {found not guilty of second-degree murder}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/13/george-zimmerman-found-not-guilty/2514163/""> and manslaughter.

Willis Johnson, a young pastor from Ferguson, Mo., became tearful as he attempted to describe his feelings as an African-American male about police.

“When I get pulled over ... I revert back to that 18-year-old and the things my father told me about what to do when the police stop you,” he said in the {interview on All Things Considered}<hyperlink=""http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=340422502"">. “It’s an intergenerational thing to know my father fears for me at 39 the same way he feared for me at 18. He texts me every morning and says, I’m praying for you, do what you got to do — but you know, be careful.”

It is a fear civil rights advocates have long described.

Here in Louisville, Metro Council member Attica Scott, {in a Courier-Journal opinion piece Tuesday}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2014/08/11/mothers-fear-black-son/13905957/"">, described her fears for her teenage son and the “talk” so many African-American parents must give their children about interaction with police.

Such comments are met with skepticism or outright disbelief in a country where most of us have no reason to fear law enforcement.

But the explosion of outrage and violence in the predominantly black St. Louis suburb of Ferguson following the fatal police shooting on Aug. 9 of Michael Brown, 18, an unarmed youth, demand that the nation examine the tensions between law enforcement and African-American communities.

In time, investigators will establish the details — did the youth have his hands up, as some witnesses claim, or did the youth strike the officer and go for his gun, as police have said?

But the event has rekindled fears and provided an astonishing glimpse of policing in a town of 21,000 where 70 percent of residents are black but all but three of the 53 police officers are white. For example:

• Police met protests with a stunning display of military might — armored vehicles, body armor, assault rifles — firing rubber bullets and saturating neighborhoods with tear gas. Much of the gear came from federal anti-terrorism money that flowed to communities after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

“Lately, it’s looked a little bit more like a war zone and that’s not acceptable,” said Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, who Thursday relieved local police and put state police in charge of security.

• Local police further ignited public outrage by {arresting two national reporters}<hyperlink=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/reporters-arrested-in-ferguson-193914.html""> Wednesday working at a McDonald’s restaurant, apparently for not exiting fast enough when officers burst in and ordered everyone out. Also arrested Wednesday was {St. Louis Alderman Antonio French}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/14/antonio-french-ferguson-arrest-released-police/14064687/"">, whose offense appeared to be covering the protests on social media.

“A heavy-handed police approach is actually making the situation worse,” Mr. French told USA Today.

• Ferguson police deepened suspicion by withholding information, including the name of the officer who shot Mr. Brown. Friday, they released the officer’s name and limited details —alleging Mr. Brown shoved a store clerk and stole a $50 box of cigars before police stopped him on the street.

Calm appears to have returned under the influence of Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, an African- American from the community leading the state highway patrol.

But the events raise critical questions about policing and civil rights. And it shows that the fears of African-American parents and their children are real and must be addressed. As Rev. Johnson said of his father’s daily warning to be careful:

“He shouldn’t have to say that. I shouldn’t have to say that ...We want the cycle to stop.”",11,17,NA,NA

Excerpts from CNN interviews with Chief Thomas Jackson:

This is a terrible tragedy. Nobody wanted this to happen. But what we want to do is we want to heal. We want to build trust with the community. And part of that is to have a transparent, open investigation conducted by an outside party and then for me to engage, and the police department to engage with community leaders, which has already started.

We've promised to engage each other and we've already got meetings set up for the future. So what really needs to happen is communication. We need to understand each other's frustrations and each other's concerns and try to see things from each other's point of view. And when we can do that, we're going to be able to better provide safety and security for the community.

We continuously readdress our practices and our procedures, our weapons, our less lethal weapons, our hand-to-hand tactics. But things happen. And this case, I know it seems like it's similar to other cases, but what I would really hope is that we can allow the investigation to play out because there's lots of physical evidence, there's lots of witness testimony and there's a lot of information that can be pulled together. And I really believe that we can get to the truth of what happened here. And, of course, we will learn from that.

There are so many witnesses that are coming forward and we're trying to get them to come in and be interviewed, so that we can actually get that clear picture. And that's really what is holding things up is the witness testimony.

We're not going to release any information about (the officer involved in the shooting) until we've determined that it's safe and that the prosecuting attorney determines that it's OK to do.

Since I got here, increasing the diversity of the police department has been one of my top priorities. I promoted the first two African-American supervisors in the history of the department and we've been recruiting African Americans.

We tend to lose people sometimes if they are able to find a higher paying position, so because of the retention problem, what we're trying to do and what we've tried to do over the last few years is to increase the quality of life in the police department so that people want to stay here.

The circumstances surrounding the deadly shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., are all too familiar: an unarmed black teenager shot and killed while walking in his own suburban community by a white male. After Brown was shot, independent investigations came on the heels of angry protests and looting. In the case of Trayvon Martin, the police department filed charges against George Zimmerman after protests broke nationwide.

Brown's death, at the hands of a white police officer, has also brought to the fore a conversation often repeated about the use of deadly force by police on young black men and biased police tactics in black communities. According to a Gallup Poll, nearly {a quarter of black men between the ages of 18 and 34}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/interactive/14034535/""> said they had been treated unfairly by police in the past month. By contrast, only 10% of whites said that they had experienced discrimination last year, according to a Pew Research Center survey (see the {graphics above}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/interactive/14034535/""> for more of the national conversation on police tactics and race).

Despite the Justice Department and the FBI opening investigations into Brown's death, protests continued and police actions seemed only to get worse. Protesters were tear-gassed, and journalists arrested.

We asked our readers what they thought of the Ferguson police department, and the DOJ and FBI investigations. Our readers also sounded off about the lack of diversity within the Ferguson police department. Take a look at the national conversation above and what our readers had to say below.

Will justice be done?

Justice will be done only because of the national coverage. The killing of innocent black youth by police will continue.

I think justice will be done, but it's going to take awhile. In the meantime, hopefully peace will be more prominent. This is a national issue, and it's good that the Justice Department and FBI are jumping in.

—@PlumbbobGreen

Anytime the news media have spoken with witnesses to a crime before the police, an independent investigation is needed.

—@ggeorgette1

Police mistreat and kill people everywhere. This happens in my country also. Police must be more careful. Also the public must educate themselves.

—@hasanmurt01

A Department of Justice review is needed big time.

—@Tech_Larry

Observation: On every other crime committed in America that doesn't involve national security, the names of the police are released. The cops in the Rodney King incident? Names released immediately. Choke killing in New York City? Police names released immediately. Why no name in this case? Maybe because racist Missouri authorities are looking for a way to get their white cop off the hook? If the FBI hadn't been brought in, there probably would be no charges.

—Douglas White

Short on diversity, high on violence

In the Ferguson police department, three black police officers out of 53 is essentially ZERO. Law enforcement's military-grade weaponry is how they exercise their hatred of black Americans.

I am a supporter of the police. However, the police serve and protect the people. The military fights the country's enemies. When you confuse the two by giving heavy armored vehicles used by the military to police departments, you have the police treating the people as the enemy. That's a bad policy.

The shooting occurred around noon Saturday at the Canfield Green Apartment complex. Ferguson police confirmed it was one of their officers who opened fire.

Family members identified the shooting victim as 18-year-old Michael Brown. Desiree Harris, who says Brown is her grandson, says she found his body in the middle of the street minutes after he was expected to arrive at her home in suburban St. Louis neighborhood.

Officer Brian Schellman, spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, said ""a couple hundred"" people came out of area apartment buildings after an officer with the Ferguson Police Department shot and killed the teen. Schellman did not say what prompted the shooting.

Schellman said some people yelled threats toward the police, and officers said they thought they heard gunshots from the crowd. According to The Associated Press, some in the crowd yelled ""kill the police.""

There were no reports of additional injuries, Schellman said.

After the crowd gathered, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, which is a city of about 21,000 residents located a few miles north of downtown St. Louis. He said the crowd was under control by about 5 p.m. and several of the additional officers had left the area.

Many officers haven't had a day off for more than a week. They face long hours, high stress and high scrutiny following the shooting of Brown by Darren Wilson, a Ferguson police officer.

What started as a small call for donations turned into an onslaught of food, water and words of encouragement.

""I didn't expect us to get this much, this quick,"" said Crisis Aid International founder Pat Bradley, who organized the collection of goods for officers and families affected by the demonstrations in Ferguson.

Organizers expected to fill a van, but instead, filled a truck with water, Gatorade, snacks and more. Officers passing by just happened to see volunteers loading donations and pulled in to help.

She wanted to get involved, and, like most 20-somethings, she turned to social media.

""I want to go (to Ferguson) Saturday and bring supplies and snacks,"" the 23-year-old Hayes posted on Facebook last week. Her post sparked a chain of more than 100 comments from people across Indiana. Like Hayes, they wanted to show solidarity and support for residents of the St. Louis suburb.

""I wasn't expecting any responses, let alone as many as there were,"" said Hayes, a Harrison College student who hails from Indianapolis' Westside. ""And that's basically how it got started. We didn't know each other before we went.""

Hayes and nine other Hoosiers, including Cassandra Gray, 22, and Leah Humphrey, 23, left Indianapolis at 9 a.m. Saturday for Ferguson, 250 miles away.

On their own dime, the group purchased water, first-aid kits, mini bags of chips and other food to give to protesters who'd been showing up day and night from throughout the U.S. to demand answers in the fatal shooting of an unarmed, black teenager.

Michael Brown was shot six times Aug. 9 by officer Darren Wilson. The shooting sparked more than a week of protests and led Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to issue a state of emergency that included weekend curfews and calling up the Missouri National Guard.

In the wake of the shooting and unrest, groups from Chicago, California, New York and elsewhere have traveled to Missouri.

Gray said her group from Indianapolis was given a warm welcome by the community.

""I talked so much about how something should be done and why isn't anyone doing anything; meanwhile, I felt like I was being a hypocrite, because if I can't go do something about it, I can't complain someone else isn't either,"" said Gray, who rode with Hayes. She believed it was time ""to put up or shut up.""

When the group arrived in Ferguson, Hayes said she was surprised to see that different races were joining together to protest the situation, but it made her happy. People were driving up and down the street honking their horns and cheering.

""It's just not African-American people who feel that the situation is wrong,"" she said.

The group met at the burned-down QuikTrip store on West Florissant Street in Ferguson, which has been a flashpoint for much of the protesting.

""The people of Ferguson were very welcoming,"" Humphrey said. ""They guided us to an area where we could put down our water and snacks, and they offered us food.""

After supplies were unloaded, Gray, Humphrey and Hayes joined in the demonstrations, waving signs and chanting for justice for Brown.

Hayes said that during the day, the atmosphere was relaxed.

But when the sun started to set, the police came out, she said.

Hayes said she saw a city bus carrying dozens of police officers equipped with helmets, shields and batons.

""When they brought all that out, everybody's mood just changed, like, 'Oh my goodness, what are they about to do?' ""

Half of the group, including the three women, left Ferguson around 9 p.m., but they continued to stay connected, using their phones to watch journalists live-streaming from the protests.

Hayes admitted she was worried something bad might happen while she was in Ferguson.

""I knew that I didn't go down there to cause any trouble, and I know I didn't go down there to get arrested,"" said Hayes. ""But part of me knew that since they (the police) were so crazy the last couple days that I could just be sitting in the car and get arrested.""

Despite the sustaining civil unrest, Hayes wants to go back. She plans to return at the end of the month and said she'll continue to follow the events on social media and re-post ""the right information.""

""I feel like some of the news outlets are projecting Ferguson as an unruly place, and it's not,"" she said. ""I just want to make sure people don't form this ill opinion of the residents of Ferguson. They just want justice for Michael Brown's parents.""

The organization compiled a list of demands early Monday morning and conducted a community meeting addressing the group's concerns about the violence following the death of Michael Brown, who was shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9.

Adolphus M. Pruitt, first vice president of Missouri State Conference of Branches and president of the St. Louis NAACP, said that the NAACP is concerned for the safety of young black men coming face to face with armed military. He said that Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson, who was tasked Thursday with Ferguson security by Gov. Jay Nixon, should be given more time to adjust.

Pruitt also called on the Department of Justice to expand its investigation to look at racial profiling throughout the St. Louis metropolitan area, including the Metro East region located across the Mississippi River in Illinois.

He called for resources to help businesses hit hard financially by the unrest in Ferguson, and social services for families who have been unable to leave their homes in the Canfield Apartments, where the shooting occurred.

Earlier in the morning, the St. Louis County NAACP requested a formal apology for Brown's family and asked for:

• The Justice Department to take over the entire Brown investigation.

• The creation of citizen review boards for all municipal police departments to ensure transparency.

• A state investigation into each municipal police department in St. Louis County with histories of racial profiling and police brutality.

• The implementation of racial profile training for St. Louis County police officers.

• Periodic attorney general reports about racial profiling.

""We want the individuals that may appear to have a private agenda to cause disruption and chaos within the community to stop,"" said Esther Haywood, president of the St. Louis County NAACP. ""We do not want peaceful protesters to appear that they are causing violence and rioting when incidents are being caused by a small group of individuals that are using this tragedy as an opportunity.""

Blunt supports county's top cop,Jonathan Shorman ,08/18/2014,12/15/2015,"Reacting to questions about racially troubled Ferguson, U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt expressed confidence today in St. Louis County's top cop.

The statement comes after one of the county department's officers shot a man overnight who had pulled a gun in Ferguson, a city that remains on edge after violence tied to the Ferguson Police shooting Saturday of a black, unarmed 18-year-old.

""The people around the country that I talk to, the Chief of Police in St. Louis County, John Belmar, is at the top of the list in terms of expertise and his preparation,"" Blunt said.

Blunt made the comments in response to reporter's question at an event in Springfield this morning. Just hours earlier, the new police shooting by the county police officer was reported. That officer shot and critically wounded a man who police said pulled a handgun on the officer.

That shooting was the latest flashpoint in an area that has experienced near-continuous demonstrations since the Saturday fatal shooting of Michael Brown.

In response, police have at times have fired rubber and wooden bullets at protesters and have used tear gas.

""I'm just really in no position to analyze, not having been there, what the police did or why they did it after the event but I do know they've had several days of trouble they've had to try to deal with in the best possible way,"" Blunt, a Republican, said.

State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, a Democrat, represents Ferguson. She has been critical of the police response and has called on Gov. Jay Nixon to be more involved.

""This fight is about making sure all young people are treated with respect and dignity. @GovJayNixon STOP GASSING US!"" Chappelle-Nadal tweeted this morning.

In a news release issued today, Ferguson police asked that all people who assemble to pray or protest do so in ""an organized and respectful"" manner and disperse well before evening to ensure the safety of participants and the community.

The release blames the previous violence on people who transformed peaceful protests into violent demonstrations, which police say are not indicative of the city or its residents.

Blunt and Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, have both called for full investigations of the Sunday shooting and Blunt has endorsed a Department of Justice inquiry.",1,21,NA,NA

Obama, speaking from his vacation at Martha's Vineyard, Mass., called the weekend death of 18-year-old Michael Brown a tragedy, and urged police and protesters in Ferguson, Mo., to ""take a step back"" and consider how to best move forward.

""Now's the time for healing,"" Obama said. ""Now's the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.""

The president called on local police to be ""open and transparent"" about their investigation of Brown's death. He said there is never an excuse for looting and violence toward police officers, and ""there's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.""

In particular, Obama criticized police for detaining two journalists during protests Wednesday, and for threatening others. Officers ""should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground,"" he said.

Police have used tear gas and smoke bombs on crowds who gathered to protest the death of Brown on Saturday; some protesters have thrown Molotov cocktails.

Obama called the teenager's death ""heartbreaking and tragic,"" and said the Department of Justice is working with local officials on the investigation. The president said he made it clear to Attorney General Eric Holder that ""we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done.""

Then-Illinois state Sen. Barack Obama's 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston helped cast him as a ""post-racial"" candidate: ""There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America,"" he said.

The president also said he spoke with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, calling him ""a good man.""

While ""emotions are raw right now"" and ""there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,"" Obama asked citizens to remember that all Americans remain united by common values.

""That includes belief in equality under the law, a basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest,"" Obama said. ""A reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman and child among us and the need for accountability when it comes to our government.""

As for Iraq, Obama said there has been progress with the limited military mission he announced last week.

Earlier in the week, the Obama administration began considering a rescue operation for members of the Yazidi religion who were trapped atop Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq, surrounded by Islamic State fighters.

On Wednesday, a Pentagon assessment team reported that most of the Yazidi have escaped, and a full-scale rescue operation would not be needed.

""We broke the ISIL siege of Mount Sinjar,"" Obama said. ""We helped vulnerable people reach safety; and we helped save many innocent lives.""

He added, ""I could not be prouder of the men and women of our military who carried out this humanitarian operation almost flawlessly.""

Obama said airstrikes would continue against militants who are threatening U.S. personnel and others in northern Iraq. Humanitarian relief to displaced Iraqis will also continue.

The president praised development of a new government in Iraq, saying it will be better able to eventually take control of the fight against militants.

Said Obama: ""We are modestly hopeful that the Iraqi government situation is moving in the right direction.""

USAToday,usa94,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/12/st-louis-teen-shooter-name/13953997/,Threats delay release of cop's name in fatal Mo. shooting,"Yamiche Alcindor, Brandie Piper; John Bacon",08/13/2014,12/15/2015,"FERGUSON, Mo. — Authorities on Tuesday delayed revealing the identity of the police officer who fatally shot an unarmed teen three days ago, citing threats against the officer on social media.

""If we come out and say, 'it was this officer,' then he immediately becomes a target,"" Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said. ""We're taking the threats seriously.""

Jackson, who had said he would reveal the officer's name Tuesday, said there is now no timetable.

Tuesday evening he said the officer has been on the force for about six years and had come across 18-year-old Michael Brown Jr. and a friend walking in the street. The youths were black and witnesses said the officer was white.

Jackson said all but three of the police department's 53 officers are white.

Police have said that after the officer asked the teens to move, a scuffle occurred. Witnesses say Brown had raised his hands to surrender when the shots were fired. Police have not confirmed that information.

A second witness has {told}<hyperlink=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/naacp-says-new-witness-to-michael-brown-s-shooting-saw/article_6060a563-d7d1-544a-8bb3-793c46be427c.html""> the St. Louis NAACP that Brown did not struggle with the officer inside his patrol car, where the fatal shots were fired. The unidentified person will be interviewed by FBI.

The shooting set off two nights of angry, violent protests. Tuesday night, police in riot gear blocked access to downtown Ferguson as protests continued.

Dozens of people packed into the Greater St Mark Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis, Mo. for the latest community meeting about the death of Michael Brown. The gathering, called by the family of Brown, was part church service and part rally as people stood shoulder to shoulder chanting and applauding.

Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown, Sr. sat center stage as speakers talked about the police ""executing"" their child.

As Rev. Al Sharpton took to the stage, he repeated ""No justice, no peace."" Later, he told the crowd that St. Louis has a history of racial issues including a police department that lacks diversity.

""We need a strategic, united movement,"" Sharpton said. ""We can't be mad for two weeks.""

Sharpton implored the crowd to stick with Brown's family in the month and weeks ahead. He also collected donations for the parents and asked the crowd to follow their wishes and remain peaceful.

To make his point, Sharpton also brought onto the church's pulpit dozens of young men who he said should meet tomorrow to plan how to keep the peace in St. Louis.

Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Brown's family, also spoke to the crowd.

""We have to keep fighting this fight,"" Crump said.

Protesters promising a peaceful demonstration Monday gathered across the street from the St. Louis County Police Department's Clayton headquarters. Also in attendance: About 50 police officers from 10 area departments.

Jackson said protesters Monday night threw rocks at police, and that gunfire came from the crowd, so officers used tear gas and shot ""beanbag rounds"" meant to stun them. There were 15 arrests but no reports of the looting that rocked the suburban St. Louis city Sunday night, KSDK-TV reported.

""This is a lot of young people reacting to getting shot at with tear gas, being met with riot gear,"" said protester Shawn Jordan. ""How else are these young kids going to react when they are being met with aggressiveness?""

At a community forum Monday, national NAACP President Cornell William Brooks demanded justice while condemning the violence and looting.

""Martin Luther King did not live and die that we might steal and lie in the name of justice in the middle of the night,"" said Cornell. ""He lived and died that we might seek justice in the middle of the day.""

In a statement Tuesday, President Obama called Brown's death ""heartbreaking,"" and he sent ""deepest condolences"" to his family and the community ""at this very difficult time.""

""As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed,"" he added. ""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Mo.,, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that's what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.""

Demands for answers in Ferguson have been steadily growing louder.

The FBI opened an investigation Monday into the death of Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday after being confronted by an officer in Ferguson, a city of 21,000 that's nearly 70% black.

Authorities were vague about exactly what led the officer to open fire, except to say that the shooting was preceded by a scuffle of some kind with a man. It was unclear whether Brown or the man he was with was involved in the altercation.

Investigators have refused to publicly disclose the race of the officer, who is now on administrative leave. But Phillip Walker said he was on the porch of an apartment complex overlooking the scene when he heard a shot and saw a white officer with Brown on the street.

Crump said Brown's death is an echo of the problems that led to the deaths of Trayvon Martin and other young black men.

Demonstrators expressed similar frustrations, with many saying Brown's death is the latest example of black life not being valued by police officers who see youth of color as dangerous. Several on Twitter using the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown expressed their anger over Brown's death.

As a result of the unrest, airspace over Ferguson is being restricted until Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday, responding to a request by St. Louis County police. The no-fly zone will not affect commercial flights in and out of nearby Lambert-St. Louis International Airport.

The restriction clears the area above Ferguson for police helicopters. The airport's director said a shot was fired into the air Sunday morning while a helicopter was flying over, though it wasn't clear whether the aircraft was targeted.",173,1081,NA,usa18 gallery

Of the 75 arrests, one man, William Moreno of Austin, Texas was arrested Monday and again on Tuesday.

Here's a breakdown of the arrests:
- 4 residents of Ferguson
- 48 residents of the St. Louis area
- 5 Missouri residents
- 18 out-of-state residents

Two people, a resident of Jennings and a resident of Florissant, were arrested for unlawful use of a weapon.

A Rockton, Illinois man was arrested for interfering with an officer.

Earlier, Scott Olson, a news photographer with Getty Images, became the latest journalist to be arrested, according to Pancho Bernasconi, Getty's vice president for news. He was later released, and in a statement Getty said he would continue working in Ferguson.

And before the protests escalated, demonstrators crowded around well known rapper Nelly, who is from St. Louis, and who was marching with protesters in Ferguson Monday night.

Nelly, who wore a white T-shirt with ""#MikeBrown"" stamped on it in black letters, cautioned the crowd to remain peaceful.

""It's a lot of people out for themselves that's out here right now,"" Nelly said. ""They are overshadowing people.""

He added that people needed a solution that goes past traditional ways of protesting.

""The way we approach the problem is the same every single time,"" Nelly said. ""We get angry. We march. We sing ... We don't strategize. All we do is react.""

Others had their own tense encounters with the police. In one instance Monday afternoon, St. Louis County police officers arrested a man walking on a sidewalk.

Two police officers tackled the man to the ground while onlookers shouted that the man wasn't doing anything wrong.

""I didn't see anybody behaving in any way that would instigate for the police to do anything,"" said Ben Mengis, 55, of St. Louis County, who said he was standing 10 feet from the incident. ""He did not do anything.""

A police spokesman could not be reached for comment.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Monday dropped the curfew that had been in effect for two nights in an ill-fated effort to curb the violence and chaos that have ripped this city since Brown, an unarmed black pedestrian, was shot to death by white police officer Darren Wilson, 28, on Aug. 9.

Nixon announced that the National Guard would assume ""limited responsibilities"" to help keep order during nighttime protests over the shooting.

Most of the National Guard units that had been summoned by Nixon appeared early Tuesday to be keeping their distance from the protests and protecting a police staging area.

""With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence, and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard,"" Nixon said in a written statement.

""This has to stop,"" Johnson said early Tuesday morning. ""I don't want anyone to get hurt. I don't want an officer to get hurt, I don't want a citizen to get hurt. We have to find a way to stop it.""

A grand jury may begin hearing the case on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. It was unclear how long it might take for a decision on whether Wilson should face criminal charges for Brown's death.",1,129,NA,NA

But conflicting information has raised more questions. Here's what we know about the hours leading up to Brown's Aug. 9 death.

The robbery

Brown, 18, {had been identified as a suspect in the ""strong arm robbery""}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/08/15/ferguson-missouri-police-michael-brown-shooting/14098369/""> of a box of cigars moments before he was shot to death, said Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson in a Friday morning press conference.

A police report on the robbery said a store employee saw a man police are identifying as Brown grab a box of Swisher Sweet cigars and hand them to another young man identified as Dorian Johnson.

When the employee tried to prevent the man from leaving, the man identified as Brown grabbed his shirt and pushed him into a display rack, the report said.

[tweetbegin 500389764512894976 tweetend]

A video from the convenience store's surveillance camera, also released by Ferguson police, shows a tall, heavy-set black man grabbing and pushing a smaller man, identified by the police as the store's employee.

Was the taller man Brown? Jackson said: ""I just think take a look at it.""

At press conference held by the Brown family, the attorney said the man in the surveillance camera ""appears to be"" Michael Brown.

The police officer

The police officer who shot Brown is Darren Wilson, a white police officer, who is a six-year veteran of the police force and who has never had any disciplinary action, Jackson said.

Wilson, 28, lives in suburban Crestwood, Missouri. A police officer keeping an eye on the house said Wilson and his family left days ago. A neighbor called described him as ""tall and slim.""

Wilson did not know about the robbery when he confronted and shot Brown, Jackson said in a second press conference Friday.

Wilson stopped Brown and a friend because ""they were in the middle of the street, blocking traffic,"" Ferguson police said.

The shooting

Dorian Johnson, Brown's friend, has said both friends were walking down the street around 1:40 p.m. Aug. 9 when a police officer pulled up beside the pair.

The officer said, ""Get the f--- on the sidewalk,"" {Johnson told St. Louis TV station KSDK}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/13/ferguson-protests-continue/13989945/""> earlier this week.

According to Johnson, the officer shoved open the car door, grabbed Brown around the neck and tried to pull him through the window. He said Brown never tried to reach for the officer's weapon.

Democrat ",08/15/2014,12/15/2015,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Civil-rights lawyer Ben Crump didn't hear right away about the unarmed black teen killed Saturday afternoon in Missouri.

Crump, half of the law firm Parks & Crump here, was in in Atlanta, rubbing elbows with celebrities at a Steve Harvey awards show where Crump was a presenter. But he was back Sunday in Tallahassee, trying to concentrate on the pastor's sermon at Bethel Missionary Baptist Church when his phone started pinging; he ignored the phone.

The first text message he saw was from a staff member in his office, Dazi Lenoir. He could tell she was distraught.

She was telling him about a cousin whom a police officer outside St. Louis had shot.

Then came a message from Tracy Martin, father of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 16-year-old shot to death in Sanford, Fla., in 2012. Crump had represented the Martin family in the prominent case that increased Crump's national profile.

""They need you,"" said Martin, a St. Louis native with relatives who knew the family of Michael Brown, 18. Brown was scheduled to start technical college Monday.

Crump now may be the most high-profile civil rights attorney in the country. This week the 44-year-old Florida State University law school graduate was heard and seen on every major network, standing next to the slain teen's parents and calling for the Ferguson police chief to identify the officer involved in Brown's shooting.

On Sunday afternoon, Crump was trying to get information about what exactly happened in Ferguson, Mo.

Meanwhile, Crump's cellphone was going crazy with calls, texts and e-mails threatening to overwhelm the device. The president of the St. Louis branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a man Crump had met on several occasions, was on the phone.

""We need you here,"" he said.

By Sunday late afternoon Crump was convinced that they were right. He would represent Brown's family.

""They left that boy's body in the street for hours,"" Crump said Thursday. ""This was just so wrong.""

Crump got to St. Louis first thing Monday morning. As he returned Wednesday to Tallahassee, his friend and business partner, Daryl Parks, was on his way to St. Louis to relieve him for a couple of days.

""We're always busy,"" Crump said, ""But this has been extra intense.""

Ijames, a retired Springfield Police major who created the less-lethal force programs for the International Association of Chiefs of Police, was in Ferguson this week and last. He said he's a consultant for several area law enforcement agencies.

""You could be a half mile from this thing at a convenience store and not know this was going on,"" he said.

The protests following the officer-related shooting on Aug. 9 of Michael Brown Jr., 18, has been confined to about six blocks. On nights he was at the protests, Ijames said there were about 300 to 400 people, and the vast majority were not involved in any illegal activity.

""The prolonged and intense level of public disorder is almost unheard of,"" he said. ""It's also unique geographically.""

He said these protests are not as uncommon in larger cities, but Ferguson is a suburb of St. Louis with only 20,000 residents.

And then there's the people who are there to see the events unfold firsthand. Ijames said Monday night he saw groups of people with lawn chairs and barbeque grills. ""They were just there to watch the show.""

Some police and law enforcement agencies are wearing helmets, vests and shields during the protests. Ijames said while the dress might be unnerving to the public, it's necessary for the officers.

""Agencies buy protective equipment for officers to use. It's ridiculous not to use it.""

""We basically have had a lot of property destroyed, we have rocks and bottles being thrown … we're trying as best we can to reduce the possibility of someone getting hurt.""

He said the law enforcement in Ferguson has used restraint when using less-lethal options like bean bag rounds, plastic bullets and tear gas. He said, ""I've not seen anything that is outside contemporary police practices.""

He said the images of tear gas being used have elicited a strong response from the public

""Tear gas is designed to deprive space, and if a cop has to push them and lay a hand on them, a fight is going to follow,"" he said. ""If people would leave, they wouldn't use the gas.""",6,17,NA,NA

Jay Nixon played his highest-value executive card — activating the state's National Guard.

Authorities have tried unsuccessfully to quell the nighttime violence that erupted Aug. 9 in Ferguson after Officer Darren Wilson, 28, who is white, fatally shot unarmed black pedestrian Michael Brown, 18. They beefed up the police presence and imposed a curfew. They tear-gassed unruly protesters and fired rubber bullets. On Saturday, Nixon declared a state of emergency, laying the foundation for his executive order Monday that called up the National Guard.

Governors often turn to their guardsmen and women in emergencies: floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and other catastrophes. Nixon last deployed his National Guard a year ago, on Aug. 7, 2013, in response to flash floods in southern Missouri.

Hawaii's National Guard deployed last week to provide security on the Big Island after Hurricane Iselle left communities without electricity. During President Obama's 2009 inauguration, 10,000 National Guard soldiers from all over the country deployed to Washington, D.C., where they were deputized by the city police department to help with security. During Hurricane Katrina, Guard soldiers assisted with search and rescue and patrolled the city to prevent looting.

In those cases, as in Missouri now, the guard was activated by the state's governor to perform law enforcement duties.

More rare is a federal call-up by the president for a domestic mission.

The last time the Guard was federalized for a civil disturbance was in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed acquittal of the police officers charged with beating Rodney King, National Guard spokesman Rick Breitenfeldt said.

Nixon said he issued the order Monday after peaceful protests and prayer meetings on Sunday turned violent. He said protesters shot at police officers, looted businesses, threw Molotov cocktails, blocked roads and attempted to overrun the city's command center. He said the National Guard's mission will be limited to protecting the command center that was attacked Sunday night.

""As long as there are vandals and looters and threats to the people and property of Ferguson, we must take action to protect our citizens,"" Nixon said in a written statement.

The National Guard will coordinate with Col. Ron Replogle, superintendent of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, to restore order in the community, Nixon said. The order gives the National Guard the authority to take all necessary measures, including closing streets, to restore the peace.

""We have well-trained and well-seasoned soldiers"" who have the equipment and resources for the mission, Missouri National Guard Brig. Gen.Gregory Mason said.

The measures taken by local police and state authorities have been criticized by civil liberties groups who say the actions to restore order have trampled First Amendment rights.

The American Civil Liberties Union said Nixon overrode constitutional rights of assembly and free speech when he declared a state of emergency Saturday and when the city instituted a curfew.

""The suspension of constitutional rights in Ferguson does much more than suppress speech. It subjects an entire community to imprisonment in their homes,"" the ACLU said in a written statement.

People in Ferguson ""want to know where they can stand and raise their voices without fearing arrest or military-style assault,"" the statement said.",58,296,NA,NA

Americans say we need to help Iraq

On Thursday from Martha's Vineyard, President Obama announced that U.S. airstrikes and humanitarian aid were helping.

USDA says $245,340, but raising a child actually costs $1.4M

USAToday,usa102,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/police-killings-data/14060357/,Local police involved in 400 killings per year,Kevin Johnson; Meghan Hoyer; Brad Heath ,08/15/2014,12/16/2015,"WASHINGTON — Nearly two times a week in the United States, a white police officer killed a black person during a seven-year period ending in 2012, according to the most recent accounts of justifiable homicide reported to the FBI.

On average, there were 96 such incidents among at least 400 police killings each year that were reported to the FBI by local police. The numbers appear to show that the {shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson, Mo.}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/ferguson-missouri-police-clashes-shooting-anonymous/14046707/"">, last Saturday was not an isolated event in American policing.

The reports show that 18% of the blacks killed during those seven years were under age 21, compared to 8.7% of whites. The victim in Ferguson was 18-year-old Michael Brown. Police have yet to identify the officer who shot him; witnesses have said the officer was white.

While the racial analysis is striking, the database it's based on has been long considered flawed and largely incomplete. The killings are self-reported by law enforcement and not all police departments participate so the database undercounts the actual number of deaths. Plus, the numbers are not audited after they are submitted to the FBI and the statistics on ""justifiable"" homicides have conflicted with independent measures of fatalities at the hands of police.

About 750 agencies contribute to the database, a fraction of the 17,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States.

University of South Carolina criminologist Geoff Alpert, who has long studied police use of deadly force, said the FBI's limited database underscores a gaping hole in the nation's understanding of how often local police take a life on America's streets — and under what circumstances.

''There is no national database for this type of information, and that is so crazy,"" said Alpert. ""We've been trying for years, but nobody wanted to fund it and the (police) departments didn't want it. They were concerned with their image and liability. They don't want to bother with it.''

Alpert said the database can confirm that a death has occurred but is good for little else.

""I've looked at records in hundreds of departments,'' Alpert said, ""and it is very rare that you find someone saying, 'Oh, gosh, we used excessive force.' In 98.9% of the cases, they are stamped as justified and sent along.''

Despite those flaws, the FBI records remain the most complete nationwide accounting of people killed by the police.

The International Association of Chiefs of Police, the nation's largest group of police officials, has maintained that police use of force is rare. Citing data gathered by the Bureau of Justices Statistics in 2008, the IACP said less than 2% of the 40 million people who had contact with police reported the use of force or threatened use of force.

""In large part, the public perception of police use of force is framed and influenced by the media depictions which present unrealistic and often outlandish representations of law enforcement and the policing profession,'' the group said in a 2012 report.

And in a written statement Thursday, IACP President Yost Zakhary said the group ""remains committed to studying police use of force issues.''

But University of Nebraska criminologist Samuel Walker, who has conducted extensive research on police force issues, called the lack of a national repository tracking such incidents a ""major failure'' of the criminal justice system.

That doesn't mean that all incidents have escaped scrutiny. In addition to federal and state prosecutions of individual officers, seven U.S. police departments have been the subject of reviews by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division in the wake of fatal police shootings since 2010, according to Justice records.

Albuquerque and New Orleans represented the most egregious cases during that time, while separate reviews have involved Puerto Rico, Portland, Miami, Seattle and Newark.

Earlier this year, street protests erupted in Albuquerque following the police shooting death of James Boyd, a homeless man who had a history of violent outbursts and mental instability.

A month later, the Justice Department issued a scathing review of the local police department, concluding that of 20 fatal shootings resulting in death between 2009 and 2012, a ""majority ... were unconstitutional.''

""I'll be the first one to say that they put their life on the line every day, but they're killing innocent people and kids,"" said Christal Kennerson, whose nephew was shot and killed by an Albuquerque police officer in 2012.

Her nephew, Daniel Tillison, 31, was unarmed at the time. Police said the officer was responding to an anonymous report of someone selling stolen stereo parts. An investigation by local prosecutors found that when the officer approached him, Tillison put his car in gear and tried to drive away, colliding with the officer's patrol car. The officer, Martin Smith, said he saw Tillison holding a black object; fearing that it was a gun, he shot Tillison once, killing him. Prosecutors concluded that the shooting was justified.

Kennerson said nothing her nephew had done justified killing him. ""Just because my nephew wasn't an angel didn't mean he needed to die,"" she said.

An Austin police officer shot Billie Mercer's unarmed son in the back of the neck last year. The oldest of his three children, now 13, still asks when he'll be able to see his father again, she said.

""I already feel like I have a hole in my heart, and to see my grandkids missing him like that,"" she said, going quiet for a moment. ""That detective, he just doesn't know what he did to our family.""

Mercer's son, Larry Jackson, Jr., was killed after he tried to open the door of an Austin bank that had been robbed earlier that day. A detective, Charles Kleinert, tried to question him, but Jackson fled. Kleinert — who at one point got a ride from a passerby — pursued him under a nearby bridge, where he shot Jackson in the back of the neck. A grand jury indicted Kleinert on a manslaughter charge in May. It charged that Kleinert was trying to strike Jackson while he was holding his gun, ""recklessly"" causing his death. Jackson died under the bridge.

Watching news reports of other police shootings ""hurts, and something needs to be done about it. The police are protecting their own when they know they're wrong,"" Mercer said.

Beyond the work of Justice's Civil Rights Division, which is largely focused on individual agencies, Walker said a national repository of police deadly force cases is needed to define the scope of the problem for the public.

""The reason there isn't one is because the information is often embarrassing for police departments,'' Walker said.

""People should be able to log into a database and identify where their own department stands on this,'' he said, adding that the information supplied annually to the FBI on police officers who are killed or assaulted in the line of duty is far more detailed.

The IACP was part of project launched in 1996 to collect police use-of-force information across the nation. That effort was shutdown in 2001 when federal funding expired.

As of Thursday morning, the photo had been retweeted about 6,400 times.

Witnesses said Brown had raised his arms before he was shot, but police have not confirmed this detail and said there was a scuffle.

People in the St. Louis suburb have used the symbol of raised arms and the chant ""Hands up, don't shoot"" in protests over several days.

Sims said about 100 Howard students gathered to take the photo.

""The issue is bigger than Michael Brown. .... I feel like it's become apparent in this country that black men, for the most part, are being targeted by police officers,"" Sims said.

""He wanted to be really good in visual arts and heating and cooling,"" Lesley McSpadden told USA TODAY. ""He was really good with his hands and taking things apart and putting them back together. He was almost like a healer.

""He fixed things. He didn't create problems. He fixed things. My son was sweet. He didn't mean any harm to anybody.""

A sobbing McSpadden later spoke at a press conference Monday evening alongside Michael Brown, Sr., the late teen's father. Together, they pleaded for people not to riot or be violent and to reflect the peaceful nature of their dead child.

""He was a good boy,"" said Brown's father who wore a shirt with his son's photo on it. ""He didn't deserve none of this. We need justice for our son.""

Brown's parents asked anyone who witnessed the fatal shooting to come forward and speak to authorities. They also asked anyone with video or other recordings to turn that information over to federal investigators, the NAACP or Brown's family.

Brown's family has retained attorney Benjamin Crump, best known as the attorney for the family of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teen shot and killed by George Zimmerman, a white neighborhood watch volunteer, in Florida.

Crump, who stood by the parents at the evening press conference, said too many unarmed young men of color have died at the hands of authorities or those acting as authorities.

""I don't want to sugarcoat it, their baby was executed in broad daylight,"" the attorney said of Brown. ""We want to know and see exactly what happened because this family rejects what the police authorities said at their press conference.""

Crump went on to say that Brown's death is an echo of the problems that led to the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Jordan Davis and Eric Garner.

Brown, who dreamed of owning his own business one day, had graduated from Normandy High School in St. Louis and was set to start classes Monday at Vatterott College, a local trade school

His death sparked a wave of anger that exploded into a night of rioting and looting that led to more than 30 arrests and two officers injured,

McSpadden described her son as a sweet young man, a ""gentle giant.""

""He was a big teddy bear,"" she said. ""He touched everybody. My son was the type of person that everybody flocked to him. Everybody wanted to know about Michael. Everybody wanted to be around Michael.""

McSpadden said she does not want her son's death to be a reason for rioting.

""I would not want them to get out there and use my son's situation for their personal anger,"" she said. ""That's not what I want them to do. We are out there marching for justice for my son and peace for my family.""

She said she wants the officer who killed her son to face the criminal justice system.

""He needs to be held accountable for what he did,"" McSpadden said.

Those who knew Brown say they have a hard time believing that the quiet, funny teen who loved rap music could have been involved in such an altercation.

Gerard Fuller, 18, has known Michael Brown since they met in second grade at Pine Lawn Elementary School in St. Louis. Fuller remembered his friend as a giant who was extremely kind. The two young men attended elementary, middle and high school together.

Fuller said when he heard the news that Brown was killed in a confrontation with police officers, he was devastated. And he said he instantly thought the police were lying.

""In all my time knowing him, I never saw him get into a fight or an altercation with anybody so I know he wouldn't go for a police officer's gun,"" Fuller told USA TODAY. ""I just know he wouldn't do that.""

Fuller, who lives in an apartment complex behind Brown's grandmother where the teen was killed Saturday, thinks the officer who shot Brown may have been intimated by him because of the teen's size.

""They (police) ride up and down the street always ---like they mess with people around Ferguson but I would never think it would go this far,"" Fuller said.

He added that he believes police officers often stop people walking around in the neighborhood without reason.

Fuller said ever since elementary school, Brown had big dreams. While many students wanted to be football or basketball players, ""He was the only person who would say I want to own my own business,"" said Fuller, who heads to Arkansas Baptist College Friday.

As the two matured, Brown became a quiet figure who would walk around with headphones listening to rap artists like Tupac and Young Jeezy. Recently, Brown even did some rapping of his own, posting songs on Fuller's Facebook page, Fuller said.

He and Brown often talked about their futures and memories from the tight knit community. Fuller last saw Brown Wednesday when the two talked about their childhoods and the futures ahead of them.

""He said he wasn't going to end up like some people on the streets,"" Hershel Johnson, a friend of Brown since middle school, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""He was going to get an education. He was going to make his life a whole lot better.""

In one of the last posts identified by the newspaper as Brown's Facebook page, the teen posts a prophetic message. ""if I leave this earth today,"" it said, ""at least youll know i care about others more then I cared about my damn self.""",183,1491,NA,USA1 gallery

Ferguson, Mo. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson has been on the force for six years and has no disciplinary action against him.

Jackson announced the name Friday morning in a very short news conference, three days after saying he would name the officer, then reneging citing a fear for the officers safety. He would not provide further information about Wilson.

Jackson also gave bare

bones details about a strong-arm robbery at a local convenience store that took place moments before Wilson shot Brown, but he did not say if Brown was the suspect in the robbery. He released dispatch records and video surveillance of the robbery as well.

Brown was unarmed when the officer killed him. Witnesses in the area say Brown had raised his hands to surrender when he was shot. Police have not confirmed that information.

The announcement comes after Twitter suspended an account Thursday linked to a loose-knit ""hacktivist"" group that released the name of a police officer it said shot and killed Brown on Saturday night.

Edward Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, said local investigators have interviewed Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson and he will be ""offered the opportunity'' to testify if he chooses.

Magee said the case will be presented to a regular grand jury that already has been seated. He said the panel has a few weeks remaining in its current term. He did not know how long it would take to present the case.

""We will extend the term, if necessary,'' Magee said.

A federal inquiry is also happening on parallel tracks.

Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday promised a ""fair and thorough'' investigation in to the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in an op-ed for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in advance of his Wednesday trip to Ferguson.

""Since the Aug. 9 shooting death of Michael Brown, the nation and the world have witnessed the unrest that has gripped Ferguson, Mo,'' Holder wrote. ""At the core of these demonstrations is a demand for answers about the circumstances of this young man's death and a broader concern about the state of our criminal justice system.''

Holder said he was traveling to the city to be briefed on the federal civil rights inquiry. He said ""hundreds"" of potential witnesses have been interviewed, but he cautioned the inquiry will ""take time to complete.""

""At a time when so much may seem uncertain, the people of Ferguson can have confidence that the Justice Department intends to learn — in a fair and thorough manner — exactly what happened,'' Holder wrote.

""Approximately 40 FBI agents and some of the Civil Rights Division's most experienced prosecutors have been deployed to lead this process,'' the attorney general said, adding that the federal autopsy he called for over the weekend was completed Monday. Like the family's examination, additional investigation is needed to determine critical facts, including whether Brown was facing the officer when he was shot and the distance between Brown and the officer at the time of the shooting.

Holder said he hopes the federal investigation will bring a measure of calm to Ferguson, but he called for ""an end to the acts of violence."" He also called on the police to help reduce tensions and regain the community's trust.

Local leaders pleaded for calm and promised changes in the police department as the city braced for another night of protests and possible confrontation.

""We plan to learn from this tragedy,"" city officials said in a statement. Officials are working to increase the number of black law enforcement applicants and raise funds for cameras for patrol car dashboards and officer vests, the statement said.

Ten days of protests and violence are taking their toll on this normally quiet city of 21,000 people 12 miles from St. Louis.

""This has to stop,"" Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said Tuesday.

Johnson is tasked with bringing peace to a city torn apart by violence since Brown, 18, was fatally shot by a Ferguson police officer, setting off the angry protests that have made international headlines.

Brown's funeral will be Monday, family lawyer Benjamin Crump said. Activist Al Sharpton will give the eulogy.

Also Tuesday, a 23-year-old man was fatally shot by a police officer in north St. Louis, just a few miles from Ferguson. Authorities said he had threatened officers with a knife after imploring them to kill him.

In Ferguson, streets were quiet Tuesday, hours after peaceful demonstrations once again descended into chaos with police saying they came ""under heavy gunfire"" and arresting 78 people.

Johnson said four police officers were injured by thrown rocks and bottles, at least two people were shot and two fires were set during another night of clashes between police and protesters that lasted into early Tuesday.

Johnson lauded local police, state troopers and National Guard personnel, saying they ""acted with restraint and calm."" He said police were shot at but did not fire any shots themselves.

""I don't want anyone to get hurt. I don't want an officer to get hurt, I don't want a citizen to get hurt. We have to find a way to stop it.""


{Even in daylight hours, life has not returned to normal. The school year had been scheduled to begin more than a week ago, but Ferguson-Florissant district officials canceled classes last week because of the unrest. Then they canceled Monday. Now they say they will try for next Monday.

""This decision was made after much careful deliberation and consideration of input received from local law enforcement officials and district security staff,"" the district said in a statement. ""We believe that closing schools for the rest of this week will allow needed time for peace and stability to be restored to our community and allow families to plan ahead for the additional days that children will be out of school.""

Businesses are hurting. Kathleen Osborn, executive director of the Regional Business Council in the St. Louis area, said about 25 businesses have been directly damaged by violence, many more simply by fear that is keeping many residents from leaving their homes.

""The tragedy of it is that we are talking about small businesses,"" she told USA TODAY. ""Yet they are extraordinarily resilient. Some of these business owners get up in the morning, clean up their damage and open their stores. The problem is that you can't get them fully back in order until you know there won't be any more damage.""

Many protesters realize the violence has to stop. Monday night, a group of people trying to keep the peace locked arms and managed to position themselves between the more confrontational protesters and the police line. However, while many among the protesters clamored for calm, some in the crowd appeared determined to provoke an incident.

Johnson said some of those arrested were from as far as New York and California — part of what he called ""a dangerous dynamic of the night.""

In fact, of the 78 arrests, only four were Ferguson residents. Eighteen were from out of state.

""Our peaceful protesters are not the enemy,"" Johnson said. ""Tonight we closed the roadway; we allowed those who come in peace to walk the roadway.}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/18/trayvon-martin-mom-letter-michael-brown-ferguson/14270421/"">""",20,154,NA,NA

Attendees wore red ribbons to honor Brown, 18, at Thursday evening rallies from Maine to Michigan, Florida to New York, Vermont, Colorado and California.

Many shared their stories of alleged police brutality, and called for a new compact between officers and civilians.

Brown, who was black, {was shot dead by a police officer}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/""> Saturday night in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. While local police have released few details about the circumstances of Brown's death, his body lay in the street for hours. His death has drawn increasing national attention, first from civil unrest by furious residents, and then an increasingly heavy-handed police presence fueled by heavy social media attention.

Kenny Wiley, a youth minister who helped organize a vigil in Denver said Brown's death is the most recent demonstration of what he called the ""systemic inequality"" facing young black men in America. Wiley, who is black, said the system feels stacked against some people who pay the price with their lives.

""It wasn't in our city, but this is our country, our world,"" said Wiley, 26. ""We want to stand up and say enough is enough, and to mourn those who have lost their lives."" Wiley led about 100 people through a vigil that included the out-loud listing of names of black men killed by police and chants of ""hands up, don't shoot.""

In Greenville, S.C., about 200 people, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, gathered on a plaza in front of the Peace Center for the Performing Arts.

[tweetbegin 500072231129841664 tweetend]

""This struggle has depth and breadth and history,"" Jackson, a Greenville native, told the crowd. ""And if the impact of his death wakes you up, he's made a contribution.""

Jackson recalled as a child the lynching of a black mentally retarded man in 1947 in nearby Pickens County and called the shooting death of Michael Brown ""a state execution.""

""If it's done by an official with a badge on and a gun, it is a state execution,"" he said.

Jackson said he was in town to visit his mother when he heard about the rally, organized by two young black men.

""This is a wake-up call,"" he said. ""I find a certain fascination with watching these young men and women be born again.

""This is the day of your birth,"" he told Ricky Pulley, one of the organizers. ""You were just now born again.""

Eric Wood, a white 51-year-old business owner from Greenville, held up a sign that said ""Remember!"" and ""Protect & Serve. No one is above the law.""

""I'm a law-and-order guy,"" he said. ""I believe in the police, but there are bad cops.""

Ryan Thomas, a 31-year-old auto technician from Greenville, said he felt that if he didn't take a stand here, far from Ferguson, that something like what happened to Brown could happen in Greenville.

""It's a problem everywhere,"" he said. ""It's not just one city, one state.""

At Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., Joann Mitchell, a 53-year-old mother of a young boy, was on the verge of tears imploring the crowd to do more than get angry.

""All this here,"" she said, gesturing to poster boards with the faces of some police shooting victims, ""is because we didn't do nothing. You've got to stop. You've got to hold on to each other.""

She went on, ""Vote. Stop letting them do it to us. Go to school, get your education and stop this, because no one else can stop it.""

In Indianapolis, Tiffany Pettiford brought her 8-year-old son, Joseph Duerson, to a rally in downtown's Monument Circle that drew about 100 people. As the mother of a young black boy, Pettiford said, she lives with worry for her son.

""He could just be walking down the street in 10 years, minding his own business, matching the description of someone who did do something wrong, and all of a sudden it's 'Stop! Put your hands in the air!',"" she said. ""And with his autism, he might get scared and run.""

In Burlington, Vt., Davaki Chayut said she felt ""pretty frustrated and hopeless"" over the militarization of police forces.

""I think it's important as a community to speak for those who are not being heard, to speak for those who are persecuted, and it's so complicated,"" Chayut said.

The vigil in Phoenix took place on a sultry evening at Eastlake Park, a longtime hub for civil rights rallies and African-American events. There was no visible police presence. Names of alleged brutality victims were recited aloud, followed by a moment of silence.

""What's it really mean to have justice?"" asked Tia Oso, a co-organizer. ""What's it really mean to have justice? That's why we're here today.""

Some speakers said they empathize with victims of civil rights violations elsewhere because of racial profiling by police in Arizona, including practices of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office that have led to court-ordered reforms. Others described personal encounters with law enforcement.

George Vick, 34, said he lived in St. Louis County, Mo., before moving to Queen Creek, and had personal experience with officers there. ""These people terrorize the neighborhood,"" he said. ""This is a firsthand account. My little brother is there right now in the street protesting. Something has to change. ... Next, it could be your kid, your sister, your father, your brother.""

Since the fatal shooting of Brown, violent outbreaks, including looting and rioting, have been prevalent in the St. Louis suburb.

Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., alongside their attorney Benjamin Crump, said that justice will bring peace to the City of Ferguson and holding accountable Darren Wilson, the officer accused of shooting Brown.

Brown Sr. said he has faith in the system and that justice will eventually prevail.

Both said despite the preliminary autopsy findings, they want to know the cause for excessive force that lead to their son's death.

With the continuous daily protests and clashes with police, McSpadden said that they will remain focused on getting justice for her son and not let the clashes become a distraction.

He was a kid who was born and raised in Michigan, drafted by the Cardinals in 1967, and saw things he couldn't believe.

Simmons vividly recalls the hurt and anger when his own Cardinals' teammates, Bob Gibson and Bill White, were turned away when they tried to move into an upscale neighborhood in St. Louis. Gibson wound up simply staying at a downtown hotel during the season, and immediately leaving for his hometown of Omaha, Neb., when the season ended. He remembers a disproportionate amount of cars pulled over in Clayton and Ladue belonging to African-American drivers.

Now, here he is, watching the National Guard being called into suburban Ferguson on Monday, trying to stop the unrest following the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed citizen shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

""This has been tough on everyone,'' says Simmons, the Seattle Mariners' senior advisor, who has lived in the St. Louis area for nearly 45 years. ""You live here, and people think that things like this only happen across the river in Illinois. Well, this is the still the South, and things happen that shouldn't.

""I came from Ann Arbor (Mich.). I always perceived myself as integrated and civilized with a broad perspective. When my wife and I moved here, we couldn't believe some of the things happening. I still remember Bob Gibson and Bill White being denied residency in Clayton.

""There was a whole lot of stupid stuff going on.''

Simmons, like the rest of the St. Louis community, is awaiting to see the results of the investigation before he makes any judgments. Yet, he feels for the peaceful demonstrators, who simply want their voice heard.

""It's like everything is fine as long as you're quiet,'' Simmons says, ""but please, don't band together and get political. Things have gotten better in some respects. But a lot of things haven't changed so much.""",64,358,NA,NA

""It's not just Ferguson. Police brutality is pervasive. It's happening in so many cities,"" New York-based social worker and community activist known online as Feminista Jones told the USA TODAY Network.

After an activist posted on Twitter that there would be a vigil in downtown Manhattan for Brown, {Feminista Jones}<hyperlink=""https://twitter.com/feministajones""> reached out.

""I wonder why they always have vigils so far removed from the people who are most likely to be affected by police brutality,"" she wrote back to the poster.

(The correspondence is {documented in a Storify}<hyperlink=""https://storify.com/FeministaJones/national-moment-of-silence-nmos14"">.)

Plans for the peaceful assemblies began through that platform, then moved to Facebook. It's an update to activism Jones compares to ""phone banking and letter writing — just reaching 90,000 people.""

""We're having a national moment of silence — one chord, one silent voice — to honor not only Mike Brown, not only Eric Garner, but all victims of police brutality, especially those who have lost their lives,"" she said.

[begintweet 499887069209305090 endtweet]

The social media movement has sturdily moved offline in preparation for the national moment of silence Thursday. Jones held a conference call with more than 75 organizers Wednesday night, and says when she went to sleep, more than 90 communities had committed to hosting the silent vigil.

Her inbox was flooded Thursday morning.

Jones, whose real name is Michelle but chose not to give her last name, references the Boston concert James Brown put on the day after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, providing a peaceful way for people to ""show resistance and protest while also stopping the risk of loss of life.""

""I wanted to have a moment of peace and self reflection for those who have the same feelings, a massive group therapy moment we can use moving forward to figure out the next steps to improve relations on a community level and stop these acts,"" she said.

""We must mourn the loss of people who have become victims, and give them a place to find healing with people who care,"" she said.

LOUIS - After numerous Freedom of Information Requests, the Ferguson Police Department released what they believe happened before the fatal shooting of Michael Brown. NewsChannel 5's Dana Dean has an in depth look at the 16 page report along with surveillance video.

This police report details what allegedly occurred on Saturday, August 9th. It started at a convenience store on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson. A call for a ""stealing in progress"" came at 11:51 a.m.

The man who allegedly took Swisher Sweets Cigars is described by witnesses as wearing a white t-shirt, khaki longer shorts, yellow socks, and a red Cardinal's baseball cap. They also said another man was with him, but didn't give a description of that suspect. Michael Brown is identified in the report as the primary suspect.

In video released today a man, believed by police to be Brown, approaches the counter and allegedly asks for cigars. Presumably, an employee placed them on the counter. Brown allegedly grabbed the box and handed them to the second suspect, identified in the report as Dorian Johnson. That's when the man believed to be Brown was allegedly told that he had to pay for those cigars.

The suspect wearing the red hat is seen reaching across the counter. The report claims the man grabbed numerous packs of cigars and turned to leave the store. Meanwhile, it appears the suspect in the dark shirt places cigars back on the counter while the one in the red hat drops cigars and then picks them up.

While this is taking place, someone comes from behind the counter and attempts to stop him from leaving, even trying to close the door.

The report claims the man, police say is Brown, grabbed this person by the shirt and pushed him into a display rack. You can see the suspect in the red hat walk toward him and then leave the store.

So how did police determine that Brown and Johnson were the suspects? The report states ""It is worth mentioning that this incident is related to another incident... in that incident, Brown was fatally wounded involving an officer of this department.""

According to the officer making this report, the identities of Brown and Johnson were made after observing them and reviewing the video.",1,21,NA,NA

The public has absorbed images of heavily armed police, snipers trained on protesters and tear gas plumes. Against that backdrop, Attorney General Eric Holder said that when police and citizens need to restore calm, ""I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message.""

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said police responses like that in Ferguson have ""become the problem instead of the solution."" Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., said he will introduce legislation to reverse police militarization.

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his committee will review the program to determine if the Defense Department's surplus equipment is being used as intended.

One night after the violence that accompanied the presence of military-style equipment in Ferguson, tensions eased when a police captain, unprotected and shaking hands, walked through a crowd in a gesture of reconciliation. The contrast added to perception that the tanks and tear gas had done more harm than good.

As the country concludes its longest wartime period, the military has turned over thousands of surplus weapons and armored trucks to local police who often trained alongside the military.

A report by the American Civil Liberties Union in June said police agencies had become ""excessively militarized,"" with officers using training and equipment designed for the battlefield on city streets. The report found the amount of goods transferred through the military surplus program rose from $1 million in 1990 to nearly $450 million in 2013.

""Every police force of any size in this country has access to those kinds of weapons now,"" said David Harris, a police expert at the University of Pittsburgh law school. ""It makes it more likely to be used (and) is an escalation all by itself.""

In Louisiana, masked police in full body armor carrying AR-15 assault rifles raided a nightclub without a warrant, looking not for terrorists but underage drinkers and fire-code violations. Officers in California train using the same counterinsurgency tactics as those used in Afghanistan.

""They're not coming in like we're innocent until proven guilty,"" said Quinn Eaker. SWAT teams last August raided his organic farm and community, the Garden of Eden, in Arlington, Texas. ""They're coming in like: 'We're gonna kill you if you move a finger.'""

Police found no drugs or weapons and filed no charges after their search, which authorities said followed standard procedure.

In 1990, Congress authorized the Pentagon to give surplus equipment to police to help fight drugs, which then gave way to the fight against terrorism. Though violent crime nationwide is at its lowest level in generations and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have largely concluded, the military transfers have increased.

Police say the equipment, which includes free body armor, night vision goggles and scopes, keeps officers safe and prepares them for the worst case.

""A lot evolved from the military, no question,"" said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Chief Bill McSweeney, who heads the detective division. ""Is it smart for them to use that stuff and perhaps look like soldiers from Iraq going into a place? Is that smart or over the top? I'd say generally that's smart. Now, if you use that every time a guy is writing bad checks, that's getting rather extreme.""

The U.S. has provided 610 mine-resistant armored trucks, known as MRAPs, across the country, nearly all since August 2013, including at least nine in Los Angeles County, according to Michelle McCaskill, a spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency.

In rural western Maine, the Oxford County Sheriff's Office, which had not reported a murder in more than 20 years, asked for an MRAP. Cpl. George Cayer, wrote in his request that Maine's western foothills face a ""previously unimaginable threat from terrorist activities.""

In Orange County, Florida, masked officers in tactical gear helped state inspectors raid barber shops in 2010 to find people cutting hair without a license. Using a mini battering ram and pry bar at times, police arrested dozens of people. Officials said they found illegal items such as drugs and a weapon.

McSweeney said it's hard to argue that police shouldn't use the best equipment available.

""It's tempting to say, 'Shouldn't we wear these things? Shouldn't we approach this as if we could get shot?'"" he said. ""How do you say no to that question?""

Nick Gragnani, executive director of the St. Louis Area Regional Response System, said such supplies have proved essential in hurricane relief efforts and other disaster responses.

""The shame of it will be ... if somebody does a brushstroke and takes out all the funding and then we can no longer be prepared for that big incident,"" he said.

The LAPD's deputy chief, Michael Downing, who heads the department's counterterrorism and special operations bureau, said officers are dealing with ""an adversary who is more sophisticated, more tactically trained.""

Downing emphasized that though police might train with soldiers, they're not warriors with a mission to kill but public servants with no ""enemies.""

""In police work there are times we have to become soldiers and control through force and fear,"" Downing said. ""But we have to come back to being a public servant as quick as we can to establish that normality and that ethical stature with communities, because they're the ones who give us the authority to do our police work.""",NA,374,NA,NA

LOUIS -- Jon Hamm, who grew up on the St. Louis Cardinals, idolizing Lou Brock and Ted Simmons, couldn't wait for this evening, with his childhood passion and luxuries of his professional success intersecting Monday at Busch Stadium.

He was celebrated as the conquering hero the moment he arrived into town. He was escorted around to VIP groups at Busch Stadium, meeting fans and players. He was driven around the warning track in front of adoring fans from his Emmy-winning hit series Mad Men. He threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Hall of Fame shortstop Ozzie Smith. He even had a bobblehead of his likeness distributed to fans before the Cardinals-Cincinnati Reds game.

Yet, on a night of frivolity, the Cardinals and their most famous fan could not ignore the tear gas in the air just 10 miles away in Ferguson. Nor the school closings. The arrival of the National Guard.

And the arrests and unrest that followed the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed citizen shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

""It's rough; it's a bad situation all of the way around,'' says Hamm, who lived in nearby Normandy, and used to make the 2-mile ride to Ferguson on his bicycle to visit friends.

""There's no positive spin to it. It's rough to watch. That's my neighborhood.

""When all of the facts come out, and all of the light is shone on all sides of it, hopefully justice will be carried out. But it's hard. It's really hard. St. Louis had a rough couple of decades now. It would be nice to turn it around a little bit.''

It's this St. Louis community, Hamm says, that helped saved his life.

Hamm's parents divorced when he was 2, and when he was 10, his mother died from cancer. He moved into his grandmother's house, and years later when in college, his father died from diabetes.

Yet, instead of feeling lost or alone, the community reached out. He met a boy who became his best friend in seventh grade. His name was John Simmons.

He happened to be the oldest son of Ted Simmons, the former St. Louis Cardinals great, an eight-time All-Star catcher.

His greatest treasure, Hamm says, was a catcher's mitt that Ted Simmons gave him.

Simmons and his wife, Mary Ann, along with two other families - Bud and Susie Wilson, and Ernie and Carolyn Clarke - helped raise Hamm. He spent more nights sleeping at their homes than his own.

""They were a huge part of my life, and still are,'' Hamm told USA TODAY Sports. ""It's like anything. You need a set of parents. It doesn't necessarily mean they had to be the ones to have you, or raised, you, but it is what it is.

""Really, I had three sets of surrogate parents. I'm 43 years old, and I still feel like I have three moms.''

Simmons is now a senior advisor for the Seattle Mariners and was at the Cardinals-Reds game Monday night, without even knowing it was Hamm's night.

He sent Hamm a text on Aug. 2, his grandson's 7th birthday:

""Just calling to say thanks.''

Hamm's long-time girlfriend, Jennifer Westfeldt, actually introduced an actress named Hayley Sparks to John Simmons, who became Simmons' wife, and they now have two children.

""Jon (Hamm) was a significant part of our lives,'' Ted Simmons tells USA TODAY Sports. ""When you're at that age, and you don't have a guidepost that's fixed like Mom and Dad, we all worried about him.

""Jon was a brilliant kid. It wasn't just being insightful, he was really smart, maxing out on the SATs and that kind of stuff. And he was drop-dead handsome from the seventh grade. He could have had any girl he wanted by the time he was in seventh grade. He could have had had half the teachers too. He was always the center of attention.

""So you worried he would do something to wreck his life. We used to always tell them, whatever you do, please call us, so at least we can go to sleep.''

Hamm, a bartender and waiter trying to make ends meet, found a few part-time acting gigs until 2007 when he was cast for Mad Men. A Hollywood legend was born.

""I stopped worrying about him right then,'' Simmons says.

Monday night, he was more a welcome distraction for a reeling region.

""This has been tough on everyone,'' says Simmons, who has lived in the St. Louis area for nearly 45 years. ""You live here, and people think that things like this only happen across the river in Illinois. Well, this is the still the South, and things happen that shouldn't.

""I came from Ann Arbor (Mich.). I always perceived myself as integrated and civilized with a broad perspective. When my wife and I moved here, we couldn't believe some of the things happening. I still remember (teammates) Bob Gibson and Bill White being denied residency in Clayton (an upscale suburb).

""It's like everything is fine as long as you're quiet, but please, don't band together and get political. A lot of things haven't changed so much.''

The midnight curfew was finally lifted Monday in Ferguson, but the National Guard arrived, bracing themselves for more unrest, while the Cardinals and Reds played a baseball game just a 20-minute drive away.

""People in St. Louis, from my experience, are great people,'' Hamm says. ""If anybody can deal with this, we can. I hope everybody pulls together for the sake of the community. Really, that's all you got, at the end of the day.''​",NA,494,NA,NA

Al Sharpton spoke against ""over-policing of low-level alleged crimes"" in the wake of the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.

The shooting of Brown, an unarmed black teenager, one week ago has stoked days of racial unrest in that largely black suburb and questions about the militaristic tactics police have used to quell rioting and looting there.

Sharpton talked about Brown's shooting, as well as the death of Eric Garner, who died last month after being placed in a chokehold by a New York City police officer.

""Eric Garner or Michael Brown could have been us,"" Sharpton told supporters who packed into rows of red chairs at the National Action Network (NAN) headquarters.

Police released documents Friday that Brown was a suspect in a strong-armed robbery of cigars from a convenience store. Police suspected Garner, 43, of selling untaxed cigarettes.

NAN President Sharpton criticized how the release of that robbery information was handled, since police said that the officer who shot Brown didn't know he was a robbery suspect.

Garner's mother Gwen Carr and his wife, Esaw Garner, also spoke at the event. Carr stressed the importance of peaceful protests, asking the audience to focus on ""justice"" instead of violence.

Both women urged people to turn out for a rally in honor of Garner that will take place in Staten Island next Saturday.

""It's not only for my son,"" Carr said. ""It's for Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo. It could be for your son next, your husband next.""

Sharpton also emphasized that protests against injustice should be done in a responsible way.

""There is a difference between having a fit and having a movement,"" he said.

Toney Lee and his wife, Jacqueline Johnson-Lee, were among Sharpton's supporters in attendance.

""Young black men are under attack,"" said Toney Lee, CEO of the music company Total Success Records International. ""This happens over and over and over again.""

He said that change is needed, and advocated for people come together to address the issues.

""We have to keep together and stand strong,"" he said.

Kirsten John Foy, the northeastern regional director of NAN, said the planned Staten Island rally for next Saturday would apply pressure for an indictment for those involved in Garner's death.

The NAN also plans to hold a rally on Sunday in Ferguson, MO. Sharpton and Brown's family are slated to be in attendance.",71,350,NA,NA

When people are exposed to tear gas, the chemical agent activates the fine nerve endings on their eyes, skin, noses, airways and mouths, said Sven-Eric Jordt, associate professor of anesthesiology at the Duke University School of Medicine, who has studied the biological effects of tear gas.

The effect? Eyes water and eyelids swell up. When a person inhales it, the body produces mucus.

""That's why many people feel tear gas can be suffocating,"" Jordt said. ""It produces a drowning feeling that your airways are filled up with liquid.""

Some people vomit after being gassed, he said.

The most common kind of tear gas used in riot control is called CS. It's a solid that is shot through an aerosol, so it becomes a gas, Jordt said.

Tear gas is especially dangerous for people with respiratory conditions, such as asthma and emphysema, he said.

Exposure can cause irreversible damage to the skin, similar to a chemical burn, he said.

How long the effects last depend on the level of exposure, Jordt said. There is no treatment. The best thing to do is to use ""copious amounts of water"" and soap, he said.

[tweetbegin 501610186512269312 tweetend]

Tear gas is commonly used by police to control riots, yet it's banned by international treaty in warfare under the {Chemical Weapons Convention}<hyperlink=""http://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/"">, which went into effect in 1997.

""You can gas citizens with tear gas but not enemies,"" said Michael Luhan, spokesman for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which administers the Chemical Weapons Convention, signed by 190 countries.

""The reasoning is tear gas and other chemicals are not meant to kill,"" said Paul Walker, director of environmental security and sustainability at Green Cross International, a non-profit organization with offices in more than 30 countries.

But, Walker points out, ""there's not a clear, bright line between lethal and non-lethal for any chemical.""

And so, like many movies before it, Let’s Be Cops had an unfortunate release date. Here are six other films that ran into opening-week issues outside of studios’ control:

Gangster Squad, 2013

The movie was supposed to have a theater shooting scene. Then, there was the Aurora, Colo., shooting during a showing of The Dark Knight Rises. So, Warner Bros. (the studio also behind Dark Knight) cut the scene and reshot parts of the film.

The Watch, 2012

Originally called Neighborhood Watch, the movie starring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill was going to be released in February. Then, Trayvon Martin was shot and killed by a neighborhood watchman. The studio changed the movie’s title, changed the ad campaign and didn’t put out the film until July.

Apocalypto, 2006

Remember when Mel Gibson went on that anti-Semitic rant? That was months before his Disney film, Apocalypto, was set to release. Still, Disney prominently featured Gibson in commercials for the film.

Spider-Man, 2002

The film had already released promotional materials of Spider-Man trapping a helicopter in a net between the Twin Towers. After the events of Sept. 11, the buildings were edited out of the trailers, posters and movie.

Idle Hands, 1999

The movie, about a boy who can’t stop his hand from murdering people, was supposed to be released on April 30. The Columbine shootings were April 20. Columbia Pictures had the picture open on schedule.

Dr. Strangelove, 1963

The day Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb was scheduled to be screened for press, President Kennedy was shot. The screening was canceled.

The state of Missouri has already performed an autopsy on the corpse of Michael Brown, the black teen who was unarmed and shot several times by a white officer. The results of that autopsy have not been released yet.

In a statement, the Department of Justice said: ""Due to the extraordinary circumstances involved in this case and at the request of the Brown family, Attorney General Holder has instructed Justice Department officials to arrange for an additional autopsy to be performed by a federal medical examiner. This independent examination will take place as soon as possible.""

Justice Department officials said they will still take the results of the state-performed autopsy ""into account in the course of their investigation.""

Federal officials had previously announced they were looking into possible civil rights violations in the case.

The incident in question has been a tale of two sides so far. Local law enforcement said Brown was shot after a scuffle with the officer, and evenreleased highly controversial surveillance videothey claim shows Brown robbing a convenience store shortly before he was killed.

Locals have said Brown was gunned down with his hands raised after asking the officer not to shoot him.

Details about the shooting of Ezell Ford, 25, whom relatives have described as mentally impaired, began trickling out Tuesday as developments revolving around the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by police in Missouri continued to escalate.

In the Los Angeles case, the police department said in a statement released Wednesday that two officers on gang detail saw Ford walking along a sidewalk and when they stopped and attempted to talk to him, he made ""suspicious movements"" and tried to hide his hands.

When the officers got closer, the man ""grabbed one of the officers,"" according to the statement, and a struggle followed.

They all fell to the ground and Ford tried to grab one officer's gun, according to the LAPD release. Both officers then fired at Ford, the LAPD said.

The officers handcuffed the injured man and called for an ambulance, which transported him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, the LAPD said.

""The LAPD views any loss of life as a great tragedy,"" Earl Paysinger, acting LAPD chief, said in a statement. ""The LAPD investigates, reviews, and adjudicates all officer-involved shootings as thoroughly and transparently as possible and with the independent review and oversight of the Los Angeles Police Commission, its Office of Inspector General, and the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.""

LAPD Commander Andy Smith asked the public to absorb all the facts before making conclusions.

""There is a lot of misinformation out there,"" Smith told the Los Angeles Times. ""Mr. Ford basically tackled one of our officers and went for his gun.""

Others, however, described a scene in which a man allegedly known by local police to be mentally impaired presented a questionable threat.

One witness who identified himself to KTLA as a cousin of Ford said Ford was shot three times in the back as he lay on the ground and that mentally, he had ""complications.""

Ford's mother, Tritobia Ford, told KTLA that police were aggressive with her when she tried to find out what happened.

""I got pushed on the ground in the process of trying to to find out what was going on with my son,"" Tritobia Ford told KTLA.

The man who identified himself as a witness told KTLA that officers also pulled out billy clubs when Tritobia Ford approach them.

Community members are planning a rally for Sunday afternoon at LAPD headquarters, according to KTLA.

Earl Ofari Hutchinson, a Los Angeles-based activist and president of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, told the Los Angeles Times that emotions over the Ford case are amplified by the developments in Ferguson, Mo., where Michael Brown, 18, died after being shot by a police officer.

""If in fact Ferguson hadn't happened, if in fact we hadn't seen what we've seen the last two days there ... I don't know there would be the same sense of urgency,"" Hutchinson told the Times.",12,376,NA,NA

The president noted that the Department of Justice is investigating along with local officials, and ""they will continue to direct resources to the case as needed.""

Since the shooting in Ferguson, Mo., police and protesters -- many of them African-American, as was Brown -- have clashed repeatedly, and officers have employed rubber bullets and tear gas.

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions,"" Obama said, ""but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding. We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.""

Some say never, but a 1997 shootout in Los Angeles after an attempted bank heist makes a good case for officers being armed with them. Known as the ""North Hollywood Shootout,"" the incident lasted for almost 45 minutes, and was instigated by two bank robbers in heavy body armor who shrugged off pistol fire from Los Angeles police. They outgunned the officers with fully automatic assault rifles. Some police had to go into a local gun store to get the heavier weapons needed to subdue the robbers.

But none of the recent protests in Ferguson, Mo., in response to a white officer shooting and killing an unarmed black teenager, have risen to the North Hollywood Shootout's level of danger. So why are police officers in Ferguson using assault rifles? And do many law enforcement agencies use them? Some have criticized police in Ferguson for arming themselves with military equipment to control street protests that began peacefully but have sporadically turned violent.

Last year, Vice President Joe Biden touted shotguns as better for home defense. One reader is wondering if they would be a better alternative for law enforcement.

That question arose repeatedly and with more urgency as Wednesday evening wore on. Police were teargassing protesters and arresting reporters in Ferguson.

All of it played out live as the nation watched on Twitter and cable news.

People across the country who may have only been dimly aware of who runs Missouri looked on in shock at what was happening in Nixon's state. They did not see him.

Nixon (or at least his staff) spoke out at about 10:30 p.m. to announce he had canceled his appearance at the Missouri State Fair and would head to St. Louis County today . A statement released after midnight called the situation ""deeply troubling.""

On Thursday, the governor handed control of the security situation in Ferguson over to the Missouri State Highway Patrol.

But despite real action on Thursday, some damage had already been done. Grumbles about Nixon's lack of engagement have long been heard here in Missouri — after Wednesday night they are being heard at the national level, too.

The single greatest criticism of Nixon, a Democrat, I hear from lawmakers when I'm in the Capitol is that the governor is disengaged and distant. They say he does not communicate during the legislative process; the first they hear of his problems with bills is after they are passed.

While that may be frustrating for representatives and senators, how Nixon chooses to engage (or not engage) the legislature is a routine decision that all governors have to make. Taking a hands-off approach to legislating is a legitimate political strategy.

Far less understandable to those watching events unfold last night was Nixon's silence on fundamental matters, such as First Amendment rights.

Nixon in his post-midnight statement stressed civil rights.

""While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern,"" Nixon said.

Murmurs about Nixon's plans after his term ends have grown louder after a visit to Iowa this summer. Nixon's name has been thrown around more than once as a possible presidential or vice presidential candidate.

Will a single night of bad Twitter attention ruin his shot at higher office? Probably not.

But Wednesday night should be a wake-up call for the governor: He must be publicly engaged in resolving the situation in Ferguson. The shift in police control Nixon announced Thursday appears to be a start.

Anything less than full engagement going forward will damage not only his political future, but far more importantly, the State of Missouri.",2,10,NA,NA

The cameras, made by Taser or Vievu LLC, can clear up the conflicting witness accounts of an incident, say some departments that have already started to use them. They may also prevent police abuse, one study suggests.

""It helps the officers keep their professionalism,"" said Cmdr. David Brown of the Lone Tree Police Department, in a suburb south of Denver. ""It's not one person's word against another. The events are right there for the judge and the jury to look at. It's great evidence.""

The cameras record virtually everything an officer sees, and can be mounted on glasses, chest or lapel. A growing number of police departments are adding them as standard equipment, and now {several petitions aim to force}<hyperlink=""https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/mike-brown-law-requires-all-state-county-and-local-police-wear-camera/8tlS5czf""> police to wear them following Brown's Aug. 9 death in the St. Louis, Mo. suburb of Ferguson.

Lone Tree a year ago issued the cameras, {made by Taser}<hyperlink=""http://www.taser.com/products/on-officer-video"">, to its entire patrol force of about 37 officers. ""They were originally worried about Big Brother, but now they've had a chance to use them, they like them,"" Brown said. ""It helps to corroborate the officer and his account, his report.""

Taser shares {TASR}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/money/lookup/stocks/TASR/""> have rallied 15% in the last two days on speculation that there will be more demand for its recording gear.

Perhaps the most-studied police department is Rialto., Calif, where {its chief for an entire year tracked}<hyperlink=""http://www.policefoundation.org/sites/g/files/g798246/f/201303/The%20Effect%20of%20Body-Worn%20Cameras%20on%20Police%20Use-of-Force.pdf""> what happened when officers wore cameras on patrol. That 2012 study found that ""use of force"" incidents - where officers used their pepper spray, Taser, baton, firearm or a police dog - dropped in half for officers wearing the cameras. And complaints against officers dropped from 28 to three, compared to the prior year when officers weren't wearing cameras. The study concluded the cameras prompted both officers and the public to behave differently, knowing everything was being recorded.

""When we become aware that a video-camera is recording our actions, we also become self-conscious that unacceptable behaviors are likely to be captured on film, and the perceived certainly of punishment is at its highest,"" the study said.

Some Los Angeles police officers are already testing body cameras as officials raise money to deploy hundreds more on patrol officers across the city. The Los Angeles Times said police officials hope the cameras will help cut down on settlements and payouts to people over claims of excessive force.

And a federal judge in 2013 ordered some New York City patrol officers to wear the cameras to cut down on illegal stop-and-frisk incidents. Earlier this month, New York City Public Advocate Letitia James called for a pilot program to put body-worn cameras on patrol officers in 15% of the city's precincts. She says she would like all patrol officers to eventually be outfitted with the cameras.

The ACLU generally supports the use of cameras, arguing in a 2013 position paper that although it takes a ""dim view of the proliferation of surveillance cameras in American life, police on-body cameras are different because of their potential to serve as a check against the abuse of power by police officers. Historically, there was no documentary evidence of most encounters between police officers and the public, and due to the volatile nature of those encounters, this often resulted in radically divergent accounts of incidents. Cameras have the potential to be a win-win, helping protect the public against police misconduct, and at the same time helping protect police against false accusations of abuse.""

Other departments that have recently bought cameras include Birmingham, Ala., Las Vegas, New Orleans, and Berlin, N.H. A survey by the Police Executive Research Forum more than 60 departments across the country using the cameras, but only two-thirds of them had written policies governing how and when they should be used.

In Fort Collins, Colo., officers there have been experimenting with the cameras since 2010. About half of the department's approximately 100 patrol officers now wear them, said Chief John Hutto. He said the cameras his department is using cost about $1,000 each, although that pricetag also covers a secure webserver to store the hundreds of hours of video generated each week.

""In 2 to 5 years, this won't even be a conversation. It will be as common as carrying a radio,"" he said. ""All it takes is one litigious event where a jury awards a tremendous settlement for that cost to be covered pretty quickly.""",1,627,NA,NA

LOUIS (AP) — Jon Hamm joked that the bobble head the St. Louis Cardinals honored him with was ""probably repurposed"" from a Matt Carpenter model.

""It's great, it's fantastic. It's amazing how many people I've had ask me to get them one,"" Hamm said before throwing the first pitch Monday night for the Cardinals' game against the Cincinnati Reds. ""That was the weird thing — aunts and uncles and friends of all stripes, so I'll probably need about 40 of them.""

The ""Mad Men"" star, a lifelong Cardinals fan who grew up in the suburbs, is starring in the baseball movie ""Million Dollar Arm.""

Bearded and wearing a white Cardinals cap at the podium, Hamm remembered watching the 1982 World Series at age 11.

Hamm graduated from John Burroughs High School and Missouri before emerging as Don Draper in the hit AMC television series.

He grew up in Normandy, Missouri, not far from Ferguson, where an unarmed 18-year-old was fatally shot by police and has sparked a week of protests and looting. He noted, ""That's my neighborhood.""

""It's a bad situation all the way around, there's no positive spin to it,"" Hamm said. ""When all the facts come out and hopefully all the light is shown on all sides of it, hopefully the justice will be carried out.""

Hamm's best friend, John Simmons, is the eldest son of longtime Cardinals star Ted Simmons. They were teammates on the high school team, but Hamm had no illusions of playing for the hometown team.

That became clear when he worked out with Cardinals players including Bob Forsch, Andy Van Slyke and Simmons in the winter.

""I was like 'Nope, I'm not as good as these guys and probably will never be,"" Hamm said. ""Fortunately I was able to find another career.""

Cardinals scouting director Dan Kantrovitz was another classmate in high school.

""I don't know if Danny was destined for a front office job,"" Hamm said. ""I do know that our high school puts out some pretty motivated and talented kids and Danny was certainly one of them.""

Portions of the proceeds from the bobblehead event went to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Hamm lost his mother to cancer and father to diabetes.

""It's an organization like no other,"" Hamm said. ""I couldn't be more sincere when I say they are some of the greatest people on the planet.""",1,13,NA,NA

Officers say yes",Christina Hall,08/17/2014,01/18/2016,"Michigan police departments have armed themselves with grenade launchers, armored vehicles, automatic rifles and other equipment — 128,000 items in all, worth an estimated $43 million — under a federal program that allows police to obtain surplus gear free from the U.S. military.

A Free Press review of items transferred from the military since 2006 shows Michigan law enforcement agencies have received 17 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles or MRAPs, built to counter roadside bombs; 1,795 M16 rifles, the U.S. military’s combat weapon of choice; 696 M14 rifles; 530 bayonet and scabbards; 165 utility trucks; 32 12-gauge, riot-type shotguns; nine grenade launchers; and three observation helicopters.

Federal officials won’t say which agencies got equipment, but the Free Press inquiry shows it went not just to large counties with high crime, but some of the state’s smallest counties and towns.

For instance, Dundee police, who patrol a village of about 4,000 residents, got a mine-resistant ambush vehicle. Barry County in rural western Michigan, with just under 60,000 residents, got five grenade launchers.

Police say they need military-grade weapons to counter heavily armed drug dealers, mass shooters and terrorists. Armored vehicles can be used against barricaded gunmen, to evacuate citizens in emergencies or to quell riots, while high-powered, automatic rifles keep police from being outgunned by bad guys.

But the growing militarization of local police is raising alarms across the country. Civil rights advocates, law enforcement experts and politicians from both parties are questioning the proliferation of “warrior cops” — local police arrayed in SWAT team gear and camouflage, using equipment once seen only in combat to patrol the streets of America’s cities, suburbs and small towns.

In last week’s Time magazine, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky and likely GOP presidential candidate in 2016, decried the Aug. 9 police {killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/article/20140812/NEWS07/308120062/Missouri-teen-shot"">, which touched off looting and violence there that was met by a show of military force by police.

“The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action,” Rand wrote.

A report released this summer by the American Civil Liberties Union found that police departments nationwide are increasingly using military tactics and weapons for such routine matters as serving search warrants, sometimes with deadly and tragic results. Among incidents cited in the report:

■ A 19-month-old Wisconsin boy critically wounded in the face and chest in May when a flash-bang grenade, long ago adopted from the military by SWAT teams, landed in his crib at a relative’s home in Georgia. Police were executing a no-knock warrant to search for a relative over a $50 drug sale.

■ The 2010 death of Aiyana Stanley-Jones, 7, of Detroit, who was struck by a bullet from an officer’s gun as she slept on a couch during a Detroit police raid. Police in SWAT gear used a flash-bang grenade in that raid, too. They were looking for a murder suspect, who was found in the upper level of the duplex and surrendered without incident.

■ A pregnant mother, 26, shot with her 14-month-old son in her arms in 2008 when a SWAT team broke down the front door of her rented home in Lima, Ohio, and opened fire. They were looking for her boyfriend on suspicion of drug dealing.

“We found through our investigation the use of paramilitary weapons and tactics causes serious problems for undermining public confidence,” said Kara Dansky, senior counsel for the ACLU and the author of the report, which looked at 800 SWAT raids by law enforcement in 20 states and the agencies’ acquisition of military equipment.

“Overly militarized police view people in the community as the enemy,” Dansky said.

For police, however, it’s an issue of life or death. “If you have to defend yourself in situations, you have to be suited to handle the situations,” said Macomb County Sheriff Anthony Wickersham. “The bad guys have high-capacity rounds. In today’s world, you just never know what you’re gonna be confronted with.”

Outgunned by 2 robbers

More than 8,000 agencies participate nationwide in the federal surplus program, according to the Defense Logistics Agency, which oversees the Law Enforcement Support Office (or 1033) program out of its office in Battle Creek. The equipment flowing to Michigan is part of more than $4.3 billion worth of gear that has been transferred to law enforcement agencies nationwide since the program’s inception in 1997.

That same year, law enforcement officials say, there was a change in philosophy and arsenals after a bank robbery shootout in North Hollywood, Calif. Two men with body armor and semiautomatic and fully automatic rifles and handguns engaged in a 44-minute firefight with Los Angeles police, who were outgunned and had to borrow semiautomatic rifles and shotguns from a gun store to battle the robbers.

Law enforcement agencies started adding high-powered rifles to their arsenals. Macomb County Sheriff’s Sgt. Phil Abdoo said such rifles are “pretty much a standard issue for police officers now.”

Peter Kraska, professor and chairman of the School of Justice Studies at Eastern Kentucky University, has studied the militarization of police since 1988 and says the police community is divided in the debate.

He said the number of SWAT teams nationwide has dramatically increased since the war on drugs hysteria in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Police have been on an “incremental march” in this direction for years, he said, with an acceleration after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

The 1033 program is just one avenue for agencies to obtain military gear. Others are Homeland Security and Justice Assistance Grants, which have provided billions of dollars for weapons purchases over the last decade.

Homeland Security money bought a new $600,000 armored tank on wheels that Warren police used Monday to rescue people trapped by floodwaters near a Lowe’s on Van Dyke near 13 Mile, Deputy Police Commissioner Louis Galasso said. He said the tank, housed in Warren, is shared by other communities and is used for SWAT deployments, barricaded gunmen and active shooter situations.

The 1033 program items range from military vehicles, weapons and night-vision goggles to everyday supplies such as blankets, boots, defibrillators and computers. Agencies acquire the items after an approval process but pay for shipping and maintenance costs, which can be expensive.

State coordinators are expected to maintain property accountability records to include photos of aircraft, watercraft, weapons and tactical vehicles, said Mimi Schirmacher, a spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency. Local agencies must return items they don’t use.

While the buildup in police weaponry started well before the weapon transfer programs, Kraska said the recent escalation is pulling departments further away from community policing, and “that can change the ethos of the department, the culture of the department.”

“Every ‘what if’ scenario that our fearful minds can imagine doesn’t necessarily result in good public policy,” Kraska said.

Today’s reality

Many local law enforcement officials say they have to be prepared for every scenario because no call is routine anymore.

“We think this misnomer — ‘we’re being too military’ — is false, given the threats ever present in today’s society,” said Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard. “These pieces of equipment are something we hope we never have to use … but hope is not a strategy in our world. Sometimes, I think, people don’t understand the reality of today’s world.”

Two years ago, his office used armored vehicles to evacuate residents from a West Bloomfield neighborhood where Officer Patrick O’Rourke was killed during a 20-hour standoff with a barricaded man. The Macomb County Sheriff’s Office sent its armored personnel carrier because it was retrofitted with a battering ram and lift to reach a second story.

Robert Stevenson, executive director of the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police and a former Livonia police chief, said many agencies have turned to these federal surplus programs because of the downturn in the economy and cuts in revenue-sharing.

“Police have been forced to put all of their revenue toward personnel and it’s almost eliminated capital outlay,” he said, adding that the inexpensive or free federal programs sometimes are the “only option” for police to obtain even basic items.

“You need that equipment ready and hope that you never use it. The fact that you never use it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have it,” Stevenson said. “Your police department needs to be as well armed as the people they encounter.”

Stevenson said, however, he would not advocate departments obtaining items they don’t need, such as a bazooka.

Since the nation’s first recorded police death in 1791, there have been more than 20,000 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in the U.S. There were 100 killed last year and 72 so far this year, including one in Michigan, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund website.

On average, over the last decade, there have been 58,261 assaults against law enforcement each year, resulting in 15,658 injuries, according to the website.

The Livingston County Sheriff’s Office has a mine-resistant assault vehicle for use in evacuations or in barricaded gunman or active shooter situations. Its main use is “mobile ballistic shield. It has no offensive capability. No weapons, machine guns or laser cannons,” tactical team Lt. Scott Domine said. It has been used for training, in parades and at community events.

The Macomb County Sheriff’s Office has acquired 79 M16 rifles, used by military around the world, and about 14 M14 semiautomatic rifles, through the 1033 program, Abdoo said. He serves as the office’s range master, as well as the use-of-force trainer, firearms instructor, crisis negotiator and grenadier.

Abdoo said the M16s, some pre-1972 vintage, came fully automatic from the military but were converted to semiautomatic weapons under a sheriff’s office policy. He said trained road patrol officers and other first responders have the M16s, which are more accurate and can shoot farther than the shotguns they also carry.

The more specialized M14s are used by the SWAT team and the honor guard. About half of the M14s, with polished wooden handles and no ammunition, are stored at the sheriff’s office and used only by the honor guard for ceremonies and funerals.

Macomb’s Wickersham said obtaining the M16s from military surplus can save $800 or $900 over the $1,000 price tag each weapon would cost if the office purchased them.

In the sheriff’s office armory sits several confiscated weapons from handguns to an AK47 and a machine gun, which Abdoo said were taken from drug dealers.

Earlier this year, Westland police received a 1991 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, commonly known as a Humvee, through the surplus program. It has been used a handful of times by SWAT and the narcotics team for raids and can be used for rescues, especially in wooded areas in parks or during inclement weather, Chief Jeff Jedrusik said. He said law enforcement personnel are “facing some of the most dangerous situations anyone will face in their lives. We have to prepare and train for things.”

The Wayne County Sheriff’s Office obtained two armored personnel carriers and some patrol rifles through the program. The carriers are no longer used because the special response team has another vehicle, spokesman Dennis Niemiec said. He said the office hopes to find another agency that can use the APCs.

Wayne County, with almost 1.8 million people, also got an observation helicopter. So did Monroe County, home to only 152,000 or so residents.

The Detroit Police Department hasn’t used the federal surplus program because it has purchased many of the items that other agencies have obtained for free, such as a helicopter, armored personnel carriers and weapons, Sgt. Michael Woody said. For security reasons, he declined to say how many items the department has. He said other agencies “most likely are taking stock (in items) they’ve never had before.”

Abdoo said an item, such as a grenade launcher, might raise eyebrows, but it has a specific purpose — shooting smoke, tear gas and nonlethal munitions for crowd control.

New limits proposed

The images this past week coming out of Ferguson, Mo., where residents were met by a police force that looked more like an occupying army — dressed in full combat gear, riding in armored vehicles, firing tear gas and shooting rubber bullets — have ramped up the call nationwide to end the militarization of police and all or part of the 1033 program.

By Friday afternoon, nearly 22,000 people had signed an online petition at {www.care2.com}<hyperlink=""http://www.care2.com/""> calling for the end of the program.

U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Georgia, said he plans to introduce legislation to put limitations on the transfer of certain kinds of military equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies, including tactical vehicles, armored vehicles and MRAPs.

The legislation also would include assault weapons and aircraft and would require the Department of Defense to account for all the military-grade equipment that has been transferred in an annual report to Congress to help track any weapons that are lost, stolen or sold, according to Johnson’s office.

“I plan to introduce legislation to do something before America’s main streets militarize further. We not only lack serious oversight and accountability, but we need some parameters put in place for what is appropriate.

“Before another small town’s police force gets a $700,000 gift from the Defense Department that it can’t maintain or manage, we need to press pause and revisit the merits of a militarized America,” Johnson said in a statement to the Free Press.

U.S. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement Friday that Congress established the military surplus program “out of real concern that local law enforcement agencies were literally outgunned by drug criminals.

“We intended this equipment to keep police officers and their communities safe from heavily armed drug gangs and terrorist incidents. Before the defense authorization bill comes to the Senate floor, we will review this program to determine if equipment provided by the Defense Department is being used as intended,” Levin said.

In its report, the ACLU urged the federal government to rein in incentives for police to militarize. It also wants government to track the use of military equipment in police hands and is recommending that state legislatures and municipalities develop criteria for SWAT raids that limit their deployment to the emergencies for which they were intended, such as an active shooter situation.

Sofia Rahman, a legal fellow with ACLU of Michigan, said the post-9/11 national security state has allowed law enforcement to engage in security measures that are more harmful to the public, such as surveillance devices that gather data from cell phones.

With officers wearing “outfits worn overseas or in combat operations to carry out ordinary law enforcement activities, it’s a blurring of the line of what they’re allowed to do under the Fourth Amendment.”

Macomb’s Abdoo said he understands the concerns. But he said a lack of leadership — not military equipment — is what allows a department to run of out control.

The ACLU’s Dansky said leadership is part of the problem and can be part of the solution. Training also plays a role as some police engaging in tactical work are trained to think of themselves as soldiers.

“There’s a reason to have separation between military and our policing,” Dansky said. “Equipping and behaving like an occupying military force, there are serious implications. At the end of the day, these are cops, not soldiers.”

Findings and recommendations

Among the ACLU findings on policing in the U.S.:

■ Policing, particularly through paramilitary teams, has become excessively militarized, mainly through federal programs that create incentives for police to use unnecessarily aggressive weapons and tactics designed for the battlefield.

■ Militarization of police has occurred with almost no public oversight.

■ SWAT teams often are deployed, unnecessarily and aggressively, to execute search warrants in low-level drug investigations more than hostage or barricade situations.

■ Use of paramilitary weapons and tactics primarily impacted people of color. When such tactics were used in drug searches, the primary targets were people of color. When used in hostage or barricade scenarios, they were white.

■ SWAT deployments often unnecessarily entailed violent tactics and equipment, such as armored personnel carriers, and increased the risk of bodily harm and property damage.

Among its recommendations:

■ Laws encouraging the restrained and appropriate use of SWAT and other tactical teams and requiring transparency and oversight of SWAT teams.

■ Internal departmental policies on when to deploy SWAT teams.

■ Local or county agencies responsible for ensuring police are not excessively militarized, such as a civilian review board.

■ Defense department imposing reasonable limitations on the number of weapons and vehicles law enforcement agencies can receive under the military surplus program.",0,0,NA,NA

Onlookers lined the streets, waving American flags or saluting patrol cars to honor Perry Renn, an Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officer who was gunned down by an assailant with an AK-47-type assault rifle.

But not everyone was there to honor the fallen officer. Indianapolis Public Safety Director Troy Riggs, who was part of the procession, noted a few troubling exceptions to the atmosphere of solemnity.

At one point, Riggs said, a small group of people began yelling at the passing patrol cars, upset that a funeral procession was blocking traffic.

More disturbing, Riggs said, was a man he saw walking down the street and laughing about Renn's death.

""He was saying, 'AK-47, he didn't miss. He didn't miss,' "" Riggs said.

After the July 5 fatal shooting of the 21-year IMPD veteran, shows of support emerged.

But not just for Renn.

Sympathy also arose for the suspect, 25-year-old Major Davis Jr., who was wounded in the gunbattle.

Friends began an online campaign in support of a ""Major Movement,"" condemning police and claiming they harassed Davis and his family.

Others, like the man shouting at the funeral procession line, lashed out at officers.

""This is troublesome,"" Riggs said.

Whether because of disrespect, distrust or anti-authority zeal, a sentiment against police officers persists and occasionally flares with deadly consequences.

Some law enforcement officials say they have not seen such tensions since the 1970s. Recent violence against officers nationwide, they say, has been alarming.

That violence often stems from deep-rooted feelings bred from the struggles of the civil rights era, feelings that are compounded by a lack of economic and educational opportunities that persist today.

Although the backlash against police officers involves whites, as well, a single tragic incident — often involving a white police officer and a black man — can stir tensions that threaten to boil over and undermine efforts to build good will.

Attacks on officers

Although local law enforcement officials point to Renn's death and its aftermath as a cause for concern over police and community relations, it's not the only incident in recent weeks that resulted in a backlash.

Less than two weeks after Renn's death, a rookie police officer in New Jersey was ambushed and fatally shot. Media reports from The Associated Press noted that a neighborhood memorial for the killer was larger than a memorial for the officer.

On Aug. 9, similar tensions surfaced again, this time in Ferguson, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis. An unarmed black teenager was fatally shot by a police officer. {Authorities and witnesses gave conflicting accounts of what transpired}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/13/ferguson-police-race-brown-killing/14030889/"">.

The killing prompted protests and riots throughout the area. St. Louis County authorities said shouts of ""kill the police"" erupted from a large crowd that confronted officers after the shooting.

In Indianapolis, officials also have drawn attention to a flurry of firearms-related attacks on officers. An Indianapolis Star analysis of IMPD data and media reports from April 2013 to April 2014 found that 20 officers had been shot at, six had been hit and one, Rod Bradway, had been killed. More recent IMPD data were not yet available.

In some cases, IMPD reports indicated, officers were shot at even if they had not confronted any suspects. In one June 2013 case, two officers were putting equipment in their vehicles when someone fired about a half dozen rounds at them.

Craig Floyd, chairman and CEO of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, said he, too, has noticed hostility.

Floyd's organization in July released a report of officer fatalities through the first six months of 2014. During that time, 67 officers were killed nationwide, a 31 percent increase from the same period last year, when 51 officers were killed.

Although traffic-related fatalities accounted for the majority of those deaths, firearms-related deaths jumped to 25 this year from 16 last year, more than a 50 percent increase.

""I think an uptick of this magnitude during the first half of 2014 is alarming,"" Floyd said. ""We should all take note. It reminds us that despite so many efforts that are afoot right now … we need to make it safer for officers in this country.""

Officer deaths have fallen dramatically since civil unrest and anti-authority attitudes helped push fatalities to an all-time high of 280 in 1974, according to Floyd and Memorial Fund statistics that date to 1791.

Since then, body armor and better training have helped reduce officer fatalities to an average of 150 annually. In 2012 and 2013, that number slid even further — last year's total of 100 officer deaths was the lowest since 1944, when 91 officers were killed.

Despite the decline in recent years, Floyd said he thinks tensions between law enforcement officers and some segments of the population are escalating — tensions reflected in the body count.

""I think we have a real problem in that there's an anti-authority sentiment that's prevalent in this country today, the likes of which we haven't seen in a number of years,"" Floyd said, ""maybe going back to the 1970s.""

A combustible mix

Anti-police sentiment isn't limited to brazen disrespect. Some experts pointed to an inherent distrust that some people, especially among the black community, have for the police community as a significant contributor to that tension.

William Oliver, an associate professor in the Department of Criminal Justice at Indiana University-Bloomington, said a number of factors help drive that distrust. High levels of poverty, limited economic and educational opportunity and a lack of strong paternal role models among members of the black population provide motivation for young men to join gangs and a life of crime.

That said, there is another undeniable factor that goes back decades and persists: the racial insensitivity and overt bigotry displayed by some officers.

Racist actions by law enforcement officials dating to the 1960s and earlier, Oliver said, form the basis for a continued sense of distrust toward police officers today.

""There's a very long history of lack of respect, lack of satisfaction with law enforcement,"" Oliver said. ""And some of that goes back to the civil rights era, when law enforcement was responsible for enforcing Jim Crow segregation laws.""

Oliver cited research conducted during President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration that examined the causes of race riots, which found blacks were more likely than whites to express distrust of law enforcement and experience acts of excessive force.

""The same findings reported in the 1960s exist in 2014,"" Oliver said.

The Rev. Charles Ellis, who works with the Ten Point Coalition, a faith-based, anti-crime group in Indianapolis, said those seeds of distrust are not easily fixed. He pointed to the controversial death of 16-year-old Michael Taylor, an auto theft suspect who was fatally shot in the head while he sat handcuffed in an Indianapolis police car.

Police said Taylor shot himself with a gun he had somehow concealed in his athletic shoe. A civil jury later concluded that Taylor likely did not kill himself, awarding $3.5 million to Taylor's mother.

Although that jury did not directly accuse police of killing Taylor, it did conclude that they were responsible for the teen's death. The judgment amount was reduced to $2.6 million on appeal.

That incident happened in 1987, almost 30 years ago, but Ellis said it's still a popular topic when community conversations turn to race relations.

""I think that more and more people are not indicting the whole department because of the actions of one or a few,"" Ellis said. ""But, I mean, it gets very hard to do when there's been a history of mistrust and mistreatment.""

Although Ellis said he thinks relations between the black community and IMPD have improved in recent years, there have been some setbacks. In 2012, a biracial teenager named Brandon Johnson sued the city of Indianapolis after he was beaten by police two years earlier when he protested his brother's burglary arrest. The suit was settled a year later for $150,000.

The officer accused of using unnecessary force on Johnson was recommended for firing by then-Police Chief Paul Ciesielski. The Civilian Police Merit Board, however, absolved the officer of misconduct six months later.

This year, a video posted to the photo- and video-sharing website Instagram showed two IMPD officers kicking 29-year-old Marcus Jackson in May. The officers said in charging documents that Jackson was aggressive toward them and appeared to be high on hallucinogens.

IMPD investigated the incident, citing standard protocol after an incident in which an officer uses force. That investigation is ongoing.

""We have to kind of jump over those hurdles before people trust again,"" Ellis said. ""But when that trust is breached in some kind of a way, like Brandon Johnson, then yeah, that kind of threatens to roll back the clock.""

Kayin Adwoa, who grew up in Martindale-Brightwood, the neighborhood where Renn was shot, said many residents there, including herself, have a negative opinion of police officers. She said she has been a victim of racial profiling and discrimination by officers.

""I've been called a black bitch, whore, a criminal, just different kinds of names,"" Adwoa said. ""I haven't met a friendly officer. I've met some who are doing their job, but not one who went above and beyond to assist the community.""

Murmurs of distrust again arose after the death of Renn. Ivory Duerson, a 41-year-old black man who is president of the Brightwood Community Council, said he doesn't know Davis, but he knew his father, who died in police custody a day before Davis' 14th birthday.

Authorities said Major Davis Sr. was belligerent and punched one of the officers who were trying to arrest him. Autopsy reports concluded that Davis suffered a heart attack and that his ""physical exertion"" as he resisted arrest contributed to his distress.

The Davis family, as well as many who know them, see things differently. For them, the officers were at fault for the older Davis' death.

""In his (Davis Jr.'s) mind, that's what he would think as a child,"" Duerson said.

Tattered trust

Despite such tensions, many people have commended IMPD for making strides in recent years toward better community relations.

Although some have offered support for the suspect in Renn's death, Ellis said, the majority of people he has spoken with have condemned Davis.

""I heard a lot of comments that just said, 'Hey, that guy's wrong. … That guy's just wrong,'"" Ellis said.

Oliver said IMPD also has succeeded by appointing minority men to visible administrative positions. The current chief of police, Rick Hite, is black. This year, two black men were promoted to assistant chief in charge of administration and deputy chief of operations, two of the top command posts at IMPD.

Although some in the Martindale-Brightwood neighborhood where Davis lived are skeptical of police, others say they appreciate their presence.

Patt Ladd, former president of the Greater Citizens Coalition of Martindale-Brightwood, said she has a high level of respect for officers. She said she has interacted with police officers who attend the neighborhood association's monthly community meetings.

""Police are doing the best they can for the few (officers) they have,"" Ladd said. ""I have nothing but respect for them.""

Amy Harwell, who replaced Ladd as president of the neighborhood group, agreed. Although she thinks some officers tend to make assumptions about people who live in a crime-ridden area, she said there are a few who do what they can to help people.

""There are a few out there that really go above and beyond the call of duty,"" Harwell said. ""You're not going to trust all of them. But you have to give them credit for something because some of them do their jobs and take their jobs seriously.""

Enforcing the law, protecting the public and building good will can be precarious, however.

IMPD recently {beefed up its SWAT team to include about a dozen full-time members}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2014/07/17/new-full-time-swat-team-aims-reduce-violent-crime/12805429/""> who will proactively seek out violent offenders.

But an American Civil Liberties Union study of more than 800 SWAT deployments conducted in 2011 and 2012 warns that the ""militarization of policing encourages officers to adopt a 'warrior' mentality and think of the people they are supposed to serve as enemies.""

Additionally, comments by the family of the suspect in Renn's slaying have become a flashpoint.

In a July 6 TV news report by WISH-8, the Davis family indicated that Renn might still be alive if he had stayed in his car before the fateful altercation. (A written statement issued on behalf of the family this week said the comments were the misinterpreted words of a mother reeling from grief and were not intended to be an affront to the police officer.)

The July TV report prompted a backlash from several people in the community, including many at IMPD. The department launched a campaign pledging that its officers ""will always get out of my car,"" a slogan that made its way onto T-shirts and also was used by police departments across the country and around the world. At least 7,000 T-shirts have been sold, according to the Indianapolis chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police.

""That's not how we operate or how we can imagine any other police department would operate,"" said Chris Wuensch, an IMPD bike patrol officer who has worked the North District neighborhoods for 11 years. ""No matter what it is, we're going to go out and do our jobs.""

Ruben Rumbaut, a professor of sociology at the University of California-Irvine who has studied community policing since the 1970s, said community trust in police is a never-ending process — and one that must be earned.

""It's fragile, should not be taken for granted, and can easily be sundered in conflict situations, especially when conflict has been long simmering,"" Rumbaut said in an email. ""When trust is tattered, by neglect or routine disrespect or mistreatment or perceived systemic bias, community doubt can become pervasive, and the police won't get 'the benefit of the doubt.'""

What if all it took to cause equitable fund redistribution for educational reform was a simple like, share, favorite or re-Vine away? What if you could revolutionize the clean energy push with a double tap, swipe or voice command?

Young Americans are not quite there but are well on their way to making their ideals reality. The Millennial generation is known for being highly-connected through social media and technology. Now, more than ever, it seems that in addition to updating relationship statuses, tagging photos and passive-aggressive subtweeting, college-matriculated students are using their profiles to advocate for social issues.

From the voluntourism phenomenon to the current the ALS [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis] {ice bucket challenge}<hyperlink=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/12/ice-bucket-challenge-als-association/13940323/""> that has netted millions for neurodegenerative diagnoses research, college students are taking to the Internet to talk about what matters to them. Some argue, however, that conversations with selective captive audiences and hashtags are not enough to be bonafide activists.

Social media users often see their views reflected by those they are connected to and may miss opportunities for serious dialogue.

Social media users often see their views reflected by those they are connected to and may miss opportunities for serious dialogue.

“Our generation needs to be careful [with social media advocacy] of the effects of an echo chamber. It is so easy to support the people you agree with and tune out the ones you don’t, so that you never have a real discussion about it. It does not benefit your causes, and is instead contributing to some of the extremely polarized divisions we see today,” Miami University (OH) student Taylor Maple says.

“Our society seems to always be looking for the next big thing. {Remember Kony 2012}<hyperlink=""http://college.usatoday.com/2012/03/10/social-media-vital-in-kony-2012-campaign/"">? There were those who viewed it as a serious issue and took great interest in it. Others treated it like a trend, like jeggings and flash mobs,” sophomore Will Lemos from the University of Vermont says.

The events of the community unrest after {the death of African-American teen Mike Brown}<hyperlink=""http://college.usatoday.com/2014/08/17/black-college-students-react-to-michael-browns-killing-ferguson-violence/""> in Ferguson, MO exemplified this trend of highly engaged citizen reporting with Twitter serving as the main hub for information dissemination under the local police force’s paramilitary state on the night of August 13th contrasted with others who participated being more concerned with the first amendment rights violations as opposed to alleged racial profiling and the murder of an unarmed citizen. Others still were completely oblivious to the events of the night tear gas bombs, rubber bullets and all with top trends on Twitter including a rerun of popular Disney Channel show That’s So Raven and 6-second video app celebrities, Vine, fandomenium with #Ferguson or Howard University’s demonstration of unity #HandsUpDontShoot eerily being absent.

Social justice educator, Jessica Pettit defines activism as, “Listening and hearing other people’s stories — being open to learning new information and challenging one’s assumptions and judgments.  Sharing information with others and hearing other perspectives.”

Her definition reconciles the disconnect between traditional concepts of activism such as the Boston Tea Party, the civil rights March on Washington and the Occupy Movement where people physically banded together to send a message and demand change. In her eyes modern activism has found social media to be a crucial spark to start important conversations and the conversation piece has become just as, if not more, important as the classic picketing, demonstrations, and sit-ins. She also stresses the impact of learning from others as well as, “giving other’s the tools to have conversations across difference so that their own self-awareness builds and gains momentum.”

Benjamin Kennedy, a University of Vermont student concurs saying, “Repeated exposure to a cause on social media may not change someone’s actions, but I think it has the power to spark a change in their thoughts. Social media has a way of “humanizing” causes and helping people to realize that everyone has been impacted/knows someone who has been impacted by the issues of, for example, racism, queer rights, mental illness or chronic physical illness in some way.”

The final verdict — University of Vermont sophomore Carrie Miller says, “Social media advocacy is great to get the word out, but sharing a post is not going to change the world. In order for change to happen, people need to know about the problem and then do something about it.”

Here are a few ways you can put the ‘action’ back in ‘activism:’

Know your motivations (be authentic with your concerns; know the source of your passion; focus your energy and follow through)
Don’t title yourself (allies and advocates are honors bestowed by others upon you; support marginalized identities with active listening, challenging stereotypes and educating yourself/others)
Get outside your social circle (challenging your views reminds you that there isn’t a singular solution to any issue)
Practice what you preach (stay true to your cause; speak out against bias incidents and daily microaggressions; strive to use inclusive language etc.)
Be visibly active (attend discussions; protests, rallies; donate money, or time of your own volition)
Self-work is key (check your biases; analyze your prejudices, do some research; understand we were learn our beliefs)

What’s your opinion on the role of social media in advocacy and allyship? Are they effective mediums and is the Millennial generation more talk than show?

Friend says Michael Brown was shot 'like an animal'

A friend describes it as an execution. Dorian Johnson gave his account to police and the FBI Wednesday of the weekend shooting of 18-year-old unarmed black teen Michael Brown by a white cop. Johnson said when Brown was killed, he had turned and put his hands in the air before being {shot ""like an animal""}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/13/ferguson-protests-continue/13989945/""> in the head and chest. The shooting has angered the predominantly African-American community in Ferguson, Mo., and sparked three nights of protests. Demonstrators are demanding that the Ferguson Police Department identify the officer who shot Brown. Police had promised to reveal his name, but changed their tune after they saw threats against the officer on social media. Things got even more tense when police shot and wounded an armed man not far from the site of a community protest meeting early Wednesday.

Lesley McSpadden, mother of 17-year-old Michael Brown, to KMOV news

Son, when you go to work tonight, if you get stopped by the police for any reason, you reply with all of the respect that you can muster even if you are being pulled over for no reason. A 17-year-old, unarmed black teen named Michael Brown was shot Saturday in Missouri by police. and I am afraid for you.

What was left unsaid to my son is that I am a nervous wreck when he works the night shift and that I barely sleep when he is gone to work because I fear for his safety. I used to turn my cellphone off at night, and now I leave it on just to be on the safe side.

I am a single mom of two teenagers, both black, one female and one male, and we have to have “the talk” more regularly than I would have ever imagined. In 2013, we had this conversation after the Trayvon Martin verdict. My son was 17. How does a mother of a black son tell him that his life has value or that there is any respect for him or his community when you see pictures of Michael Brown’s body inside of yellow police tape and no one has bothered to fully cover his corpse? How dehumanizing.

What cuts like a knife when I think about Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, John Crawford, Michael Newby, Amadou Diallo and so many other black men and teens is that their lives were taken by police officers (or law enforcement authorities and wannabe law enforcement in the case of Trayvon Martin). We should not have to live in fear of the people who are paid to protect and to serve our communities; yet, I have to teach my son to live with that fear every single day — it is a matter of survival.

After our black youths are killed by law enforcement follows the assassination of their character in order to justify their murder. Peace signs become gang signs. Hoodies become the clothing of violent youths. Instagram pictures become reality when the day before they were just photos.

As a mom, I feel helpless. What mom wants to feel helpless, especially when the violence is inflicted by people who are paid by our tax dollars? No, we cannot dictate how people will respond to governmental injustice. But we can listen to their pain and outrage.

We are weak in this community and in this country when it comes to having honest conversations about race. We are not post-racial. Police officers have always had a license to kill unarmed black teens. What is a mother supposed to do with that knowledge besides teach her son to live in fear — and fear does not equate respect.

As a community, we need to have “the talk” with police. In 2013, Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad was part of a community conversation at the Parkland Boys & Girls Club in which young black men spoke bluntly about their interactions with police officers. Did our police chief find excuses for his officers’ behavior? No. Chief Conrad began his response with an apology to these young men. I was shocked because far too often young black men are not listened to without interruption and are often treated as if they deserve to be disrespected.

I know what it is like to grow up with distrust and malice toward police officers. I grew up in Beecher Terrace and the Jungle in Los Angeles knowing that policing is not community building.

When we see uprisings in cities like Ferguson, Mo., it is one way in which people who are frustrated tell authorities that we must condemn police brutality, racial profiling, use of excessive force, the militarization of peaceful protests and shoot-to-kill policies. In his speech, “The Other America,” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. reminds us that “... a riot is the language of the unheard.”

Police have the statutory authority to make life and death decisions, and police are human and subject to prejudices, psychological pathologies, racial bias, corruption, poor judgment and all the other foibles of mankind.

But because their decisions can result in abuse and fatalities, transparency and public oversight should be mandatory whether they object to it or not.

Edward Lumas; Grand Rapids, Mich.
Your article on police shootings would have benefited from a less superficial interpretation of skimpy data. It failed to mention the local crime rate or number of police officers and innocent bystanders killed by violent crimes.

Moreover, the article states that blacks make up 70% of the residents of Ferguson, Mo., but then fails to differentiate data based on dissimilar demographics. You appear to have included communities that are mostly white ({Albuquerque}<hyperlink=""http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/35/3502000.html"">) or mostly black ({New Orleans}<hyperlink=""http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22/2255000.html"">), for example, in your analysis of police response. A major problem with databases is the misuse of data to support a bias. Your readers deserve a more scholarly article.

Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:

We will never know the real number of people killed by police because complete statistics aren't kept. Whether the killings were justified or not, it seems that would be an easy statistic to keep.

Last year, 111 police died in the line of duty. Of those, 46 were from traffic accidents and 14 from heart attacks. It's a myth that large numbers of police are being killed by bad guys.

Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., says he plans to introduce legislation when Congress returns in September to curb what he describes as an increasing militarization of police agencies across the country.

""Our Main Streets should be a place for business, families and relaxation, not tanks and M16s,"" Johnson said Thursday. ""Militarizing America's Main Streets won't make us any safer, just more fearful and more reticent.""

Attorney General Eric Holder said he's concerned that use of military equipment by police in Ferguson, Missouri, is sending a ""conflicting message."" Holder said authorities there have accepted the Justice Department's offer of crowd-control help as it continues to investigate the Saturday shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

The response by law enforcement to protests ""must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them,"" Holder said.

A spokesman for the Defense Logistics Agency, the government's combat logistics support agency, said the Ferguson Police Department has been part of the surplus equipment program. It received two tactical vehicles — both Humvees — as well as a generator and a trailer and may have received other equipment, DLA spokesman Joe Yoswa said.

The FBI and Justice Department are conducting a civil rights investigation into the shooting. Eyewitnesses have already been interviewed, Holder said.

""We need to demilitarize this situation_this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution,"" said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who was in Ferguson on Thursday.

Johnson said his bill would limit the kinds of military equipment that can be transferred to local law enforcement agencies and require states to certify they can account for all equipment received.

He said he is disturbed by reports that some weapons and other equipment distributed to police agencies have gone missing. He also expressed concern that the trend toward militarizing has moved beyond local police departments and sheriff's offices, saying Ohio State University recently acquired a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle, or MRAP.

""Apparently, college kids are getting too rowdy,"" Johnson said.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blamed the trend on the federal government.

""There should be a difference between a police response and a military response"" to street protests, Paul, a possible GOP presidential contender in 2016, wrote in an opinion column in Time magazine.

""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies — where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement,"" Paul wrote.

Johnson, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, cites a 24-year-old program that lets local police agencies acquire for free surplus military equipment ranging from blankets and bayonets to tanks. An Associated Press investigation last year found that a large share of the $4.2 billion in surplus military gear distributed by the program since 1990 went to police and sheriff's departments in rural areas with few officers and little crime.

Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, defended the program as useful because ""it allows for the reuse of military equipment that otherwise would be disposed of.""

Asked whether events in Missouri had given the Pentagon reason to reconsider the program, Kirby said, ""It is up to law enforcement agencies to speak to how and what they gain through this system.""

A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, declined to comment on Johnson's proposal.

In a statement about the shooting, Boehner said he supports ""a full and thorough investigation"" of the events surrounding Brown's death, as well as subsequent actions, including the detention of journalists covering the protests.",2,33,NA,NA

Los Angeles lawyer Steven Lerman told USA TODAY in an interview on Friday that he plans on filing a federal civil rights lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles by Wednesday. The suit will seek compensatory damages, Lerman said.

Los Angeles police have said officers shot the man, Ezell Ford, who is black, after he reached for an officer's gun during a scuffle.

Lerman made the comments in relation to the death in South Los Angeles Monday of Ezell Ford, who witnesses said police shot in the back three times as he lay on the ground. One witness described Ford as mentally impaired and cooperative. Witnesses also said that when Ford's mother approached police to ask what happened, they pulled out billy clubs.

The Los Angeles Police Department says two officers on gang patrol saw Ford walking along a sidewalk and when they approached him, he attempted to hide his hands. During a scuffle, according to an LAPD statement, Ford reached for the gun in one officer's holster. Both officers then shot at Ford, the LAPD said. The officers called for an ambulance and handcuffed Ford, who was pronounced dead at a hospital.

The developments have been generating national attention in the wake of events in Ferguson, Mo., where protests and have taken place for several nights in reaction to last Saturday's death of teen Michael Brown after being shot by a police officer.

As tensions have escalated over these two deaths and one other of a black man in Staten Island, N.Y., the union representing LAPD officers -- the Los Angeles Police Protective League -- released a statement pleading with the public to take time to learn the facts in the Ezell Ford case before rushing to judgment.

""The LAPPL reminds everyone that it is necessary for a thorough and transparent investigation to take place so the final conclusion is trustworthy and can withstand critical scrutiny -- and that will take time,"" according to the statement attributed to LAPPL President Tyler Izen.

Ford ""grabbed one of the officers"" and then tried to remove his handgun, ""prompting a deadly use of force,"" Izen said in the statement. ""It goes without saying that no officer ever comes to work with the intention of taking a human life. However, when forced to make split-second, life-or-death decisions under stressful situations, officers rely on their training and what the law allows when using deadly force.""

Lerman said that the lawsuit he is preparing will allege a deprivation of civil rights leading to wrongful death and that he has a team of former law enforcement officers and former FBI agents investigating.

He's also now $2 billion lighter. The NBA Board of Governors had previously approved the deal, which was officially closed after a California court issued an order confirming the authority of Shelly Sterling to sell the team on behalf of the Sterling Family Trust, the league said. Shelly Sterling was the sole trustee after her husband was found mentally incapacitated by two doctors and subsequently removed as a co-trustee. While the sale may not end all the litigation, it should end any potential controversy involving Clippers players, who had talked about a possible boycott if Sterling were still the owner when the 2014-15 season started in October. Coach Doc Rivers, who also had discussed the possibility of resigning if a change in ownership did not occur, called Tuesday's sale ""an amazing new day in Clippers history.""

A vigil in response to the incident was scheduled for Tuesday evening in Los Angeles, said Officer Jane Kim, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department.

A woman who said she was the mother of the deceased told KTLA that the victim's name was Ezell Ford. The woman, who said her name is Tritobia Ford, told KTLA that her son was lying on the ground and complying with police commands when police shot him three times. She said police would give her no information about the shooting.

A man who identified himself as a cousin of Ezell Ford told KTLA that every police officer in the area knows that Ford had ""mental problems"" and ""complications."" The man told KTLA that police shot Ezell Ford in the back, and that when Ford's mother approached police asking for information, they pulled out billy clubs.

The LAPD said in a statement that the incident will be reviewed by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Justice System Integrity Division and other agencies.

The incident took place at about 8:20 p.m. Monday night as officers conducted an investigative stop, according to the LAPD statement. During that stop, ""a struggle ensued"" and this resulted in an ""officer-involved shooting,"" according to the statement.

The man underwent surgery at a local hospital and died, the LAPD said.

Police Chief Charlie Beck, the LAPD Office of the Inspector General and Board of Police Commissioners will likely review the incident, KTLA reported the LAPD said.

According to the LAPD statement, the agency's Force Investigation Division also will review.",267,14716,NA,NA
USAToday,usa148,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2014/08/17/pulling-trigger-duty/14191107/,Officer-involved shooting analysis tracks Coachella Valley trends,"Brett Kelman, The Desert Sun ",08/17/2014,01/18/2016,"Benjamin Meza was walking his dog across South Camino Real when he spotted the policemen down the street. They circled a car with their guns drawn, demanding that two suspected burglars step out of the vehicle. When the driver refused, an officer zapped him with a stun gun.

That could have been the end of it, but it wasn't. Despite the electric shock, the driver fought back. Officers tried to pull the suspect out of the car, but he clung to the wheel and hit the gas. The car lurched backwards, knocking three officers to the ground, then sped forward, the driver's side door hanging open, the headlights off.

Three officers opened fire despite a department policy that discourages shooting at a moving vehicle. One bullet flew by the car and down the dark neighborhood street. Pain shot through Meza's leg. The car drove off into the night.

Meza, an innocent bystander, was inadvertently shot by the Palm Springs Police Department on Jan. 9, 2013. He survived, but the shooting is just one example of the profound consequences when officers choose to use deadly force.

""If all they were doing was staking out a burglary suspect … I don't know why guns had to be involved at all,"" said Steve Abraham, 60, who lives on the street corner where Meza was shot. ""I don't want people shooting ... down my street. Somebody that you care about might be standing in the way.""

Although police officers are trained to use deadly force, gunshots are reserved as the last resort, and most officers go decades without shooting at a suspect and some never fire a weapon during a confrontation.

Over the past month, The Desert Sun studied more than 100 Riverside County police shootings, using public records to identify officers who have pulled the trigger in more than one incident. The Desert Sun conducted this first-ever analysis of regional police records in order to understand the frequency and circumstances of police shootings.

The analysis found that three Coachella Valley officers have fired a gun in the line of duty more than once since 2009.

The Desert Sun's analysis was made possible by a recent ruling from the California Supreme Court, which determined police departments should release the names of officers who fire their guns in the line of duty unless there is a specific threat against those officers. The ruling stemmed from a dispute between the Los Angeles Times and the Long Beach police union, who tried to halt the release of officers names. Many police departments have withheld these identities in the past, but the justices ruled ""the public's interest in the conduct of its peace officers is particularly great because such shootings often lead to severe injury or death.""

The three desert officers who've fired their guns more than once since 2009 are:

• Chad Nordman, a Palm Springs officer who fatally shot a Marine in November 2012, and then fired on the fleeing car on South Camino Real two months later.

• Alex Franco, an Indio officer who fired at two people after a car chase in September 2010, and then fatally shot a cyclist in the back in February 2013.

• Miguel Preciado, a Desert Hot Springs officer who killed an aggressive dog in October 2012, and then shot and killed a suspected car thief in August 2013.

Five deputies from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department have also fired their weapons twice since 2009, but nearly all of those shootings occurred in the western half of the county, mostly in the cities of Menifee, Lake Elsinore and the area of Highgrove.

Sheriff's deputy Robert Carrasco pulled the trigger the most. Since 2009, Carrasco has fired his gun in three separate shootings — two in the city of Jurupa Valley, once in the unincorporated area of Glen Avon. Two of the shootings were fatal.

The fact that these officers have fired their guns in more than one shooting does not necessarily mean they are prone to excessive force, said Geoffery Alpert, a deadly force expert at the University of South Carolina.

However, multiple shootings by a single officer should be a red flag for police supervisors, who must scrutinize the shootings, both individually and as a whole, to see if more gunfire can be prevented, Alpert said.

""Each time a trigger is pulled, there has to be an objective reason for pulling it,"" Alpert said. ""Because they can be the judge, jury and executioner. You can't take the bullet back once you pull the trigger.""

Despite the release of these names, the circumstances of many police shootings remain shrouded in secrecy.

Typically, after a police shooting, authorities disclose that a shooting ""occurred"" but release little or no detail. Later, after criminal and administrative investigations, the results are rarely publicized. Details must be gleaned from other sources, like witnesses and lawsuits.

Police officers are only supposed to use deadly force if they have a reasonable fear that a suspect presents an imminent threat of death or serious harm. In many shootings, years will pass before authorities reveal what prompted an officer to fire a gun, whether the victims had a weapon, or if they made any aggressive action at all. Sometimes this information is never released at all.

After the Supreme Court ruling, The Desert Sun filed public records requests with each of the police agencies that operate in the Coachella Valley. Officers' names were released by the sheriff, the California Highway Patrol and police departments in Cathedral City, Desert Hot Springs and Indio.

The lone holdout has been the Palm Springs Police Department. Despite the Supreme Court ruling, the Palm Springs police union has taken the city and The Desert Sun to court in an effort to halt the release of these names, hoping to keep the officers' identities secret, much like the Long Beach union did in the California Supreme Court case.

The police union has argued the officers' names should stay secret because any officer who fires his gun is a victim of a crime, and therefore his identity should be protected by the California Victims' Bill of Rights. The union also argues the Supreme Court decision is not retroactive, and that the value of police anonymity outweighs the public's need to know.

Although Palm Springs withheld the names, The Desert Sun was able to identify nearly all of the officers through independent reporting.

Since 2009, the Coachella Valley has had at least 28 police shootings, about a third of which were fatal. Indio police recorded eight shootings, the most.

Elsewhere in the county, sheriff's deputies and highway patrol officers have fired their guns in at least 74 shootings during the same time period.

Some of these shootings involved as many as eight officers firing at once, unloading a hailstorm of bullets during a firefight. Others involved only one officer and few witnesses, prompting lawsuits and claims of excessive force. At least one was an accident, a bullet fired into the ground by an inadvertent trigger squeeze.

This shooting tally excludes 101 incidents in which sheriff's deputies fired at dogs, including 23 in the valley. The sheriff's department contends dog shootings are not subject to public review and declined to identify the officers who shot their guns in these incidents.

Nationwide, hundreds of people a year are killed in confrontations with law enforcement. The number of officers killed in the line of duty is also rising after years of decline. About 400 people are killed each year in ""justifiable homicides"" by law enforcement, according to FBI statistics. This count only includes people who were shot in the commission of a felony, and excludes victims who were wrongly shot by police.

Thirty-eight police officers have been killed in attacks so far in 2014, according to the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Law enforcement deaths had been dropping over the prior three years: 72 were killed in 2011; 48 were killed in 2012; and 27 were killed in 2013.

Few recent police shootings have drawn the level of criticism as the Aug. 9 killing of an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis. Police have said that Michael Brown, 18, was shot after he attacked an officer, but witnesses have disputed the story, insisting Brown was shot after he raised his arms to surrender. The death spurred protests, riots and an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. Ferguson police identified the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson, on Friday.

Shot in the back

In the final moments of Valentine's Day, six gunshots pierced the night air in Indio. A young man screamed, then collapsed on the ground at the base of a chain-link fence. One bullet had struck him in the buttocks, then blasted out his chest. Another tore into his abdomen.

Alejandro Rendon, a 23-year-old farm-worker, was trying to run away.

An unarmed cyclist, Rendon was shot twice by Indio police Officer Alex Franco, one of the three desert police officers to have fired his gun in more than one incident since 2009. Franco shot Rendon about 11:30 p.m. on Feb. 14, 2013. Rendon was declared dead an hour later at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage.

One of the last people to see Rendon alive was his sister, Margarita.

Rendon left her apartment on his bicycle, headed for their mother's house, about an hour before the shooting. ""See you tomorrow,"" she said as he stepped out the door. The next day, as Margarita worked on a farm in Thermal, she got a tearful call from her sister.

""She just said 'Our brother is dead,' "" Margarita Rendon told The Desert Sun on Wednesday. ""I didn't believe it. It didn't hit me until the day I saw him in his casket. That was the day ... I knew he was gone.""

Rendon was shot on Miles Avenue in a residential area of central Indio, after Franco spotted him during a routine patrol. Franco decided to stop the ""suspicious"" cyclist, who may have been missing a headlight.

Rendon had marijuana and methamphetamine in his system and tried to flee from the officer. He abandoned his bicycle on the sidewalk, then rushed toward the chain-link fence. Franco stopped his car in the roadway, then stepped out of the driver's side door.

What happened next is a matter of dispute.

According to federal court documents, Franco said that at the moment he shot the cyclist, Rendon was facing him, staring him down over the hood of the patrol car. Rendon was unarmed, but Franco said the young man raised his hands together, as if he was holding a pistol.

Two experts have disputed Franco's story, insisting that Rendon was shot in the back as he tried to escape over the fence.

Dr. Michael Baden, a retired medical examiner and forensic pathologist, and Ronald Scott, a retired ballistics expert from the Massachusetts State Police, both said Rendon's bullet wounds reveal he was shot from behind and below as he swung over the fence.

These experts testified on behalf of Rendon's family, who sued the Indio Police Department two months after the shooting. A federal jury awarded the family $1.9 million in July.

For Margarita, this verdict only raised more questions. If the experts had said Franco's story was false, and a jury had found enough evidence to rule against the police department, why was there not enough evidence to arrest Franco? Why does he still work at the department?

""I don't think any money in the world is going to bring my brother back,"" Margarita Rendon said. ""And (Franco) is still out there, happy. He still gets to go to his family to have dinner, have Christmas. But we don't get to see my brother anymore. ... It's not fair that he gets to be happy while we are not. That's not justice. He killed an innocent person. He deserves to be in jail just like anyone else. If it had been me, or you, or anybody else, we would be serving, like, a 25-to-life sentence in prison.""

Despite testimony that questions Franco's version of the shooting, the Indio Police Department supported the officer's decision to fire on the cyclist.

The sheriff's department, which conducted a criminal investigation of the shooting, said they did not find probable cause that Franco had committed any crime. The shooting was investigated by the central homicide unit, and their findings ""corroborated"" Franco's version of the shooting, according to a department statement.

The Rendon shooting was Franco's second shooting in three years. The officer also fired on a two-door sedan in the early morning hours of Sept. 26, 2010.

The 2010 incident began when Franco tried to pull over the sedan while driving south on Calhoun Street about 1:30 a.m. The sedan fled, so Franco chased the car through Coachella, where it crashed into roadside shrubs on La Playa Street.

As two men stepped out of the car, attempting to flee on foot, Franco opened fire. Both suspects ran from the scene. The passenger, a 17-year-old, was found later, unharmed. The driver was never caught, so it is unclear if he was shot.

Following questions from The Desert Sun over the past week, the Indio Police Department and sheriff's department released new details about the 2010 shooting.

Sgt. Daniel Marshall, a department spokesman, said Franco initially tried to pull over the sedan because it was speeding with no headlights. Franco also realized the sedan matched the description of a vehicle involved in a drive-by shooting in Coachella.

After the crash, the driver immediately fled, but the teenaged passenger stayed in the car, suspiciously digging under the seat. Franco shouted for the suspect to stay still, but he jumped out of the sedan with ""his hands obscured,"" according to a statement from the sheriff's department.

""Based on the violent nature of the investigation that led to the pursuit, the passenger's suspicious movements and the refusal to comply with commands not to move, Officer Franco believed his life was in immediate danger and discharged his firearm at the passenger,"" the sheriff's department said.

Marshall said a .22-caliber rifle was found in the backyard of a house close to where the passenger was caught, and that matching ammunition was found in the passenger's possession.

The sheriff's department investigated this shooting as well. Franco was cleared.

In an emailed statement, Indio Police Chief Richard Twiss said police shootings are tragic incidents that ""occur rapidly.""

""Split second decisions must be made, which affect many lives and communities. This is why such a thorough multi-agency investigative process is embraced by the Indio Police Department,"" Twiss said in the statement.

Franco declined an interview. In an email, the officer said both shootings had been investigated, and that his goal was to ""move on in (his) career.""

Marine killed in Palm Springs parking garage

In Palm Springs, Nordman's shootings involved two suspects who were fleeing, one who died after being shot. Police will not answer questions about either incident.

Nordman was one of two police officers who shot at Twentynine Palms Marine Cpl. Allan DeVillena II on Nov. 10, 2012.

The shooting occurred about 2 a.m., when DeVillena, 22, and another Marine, Pfc. Clinton Harris, entered a downtown parking garage to retrieve their car after an evening in the bars along Palm Canyon Drive. The two Marines climbed into a black Chrysler 300, then drove to the bottom floor of the garage to talk to a group of women who had gathered for a bachelorette party.

According to a police news release, which did not name the officers, Nordman and another officer, Mike Heron, were drawn to the garage by the sounds of shouting. Inside, they saw the two Marines — recognizing them from a public intoxication call earlier that night — about to drive away. The officers shouted for the Marines to stop, but the Marines ignored orders and the Chrysler kept moving.

""One of the officers (Nordman) climbed partially through the passenger side window, attempting to stop the vehicle,"" the release said. ""The suspect accelerated directly toward the second officer (Heron), striking him and continued on with the initial officer suspended from the passenger side window. ... In the course of these events, fearing for their safety and the safety of others, both officers discharged their weapons.""

DeVillena was shot six times and died at the scene. Harris was unhurt.

Although the Palm Springs Police Department has insisted the shooting was an act of self-defense, a witness has disputed this story, insisting that the shooting was ""malicious"" and the officers are ""murderers.""

Lesley Lynn Diggins, 42, the designated driver for the bachelorette party, said in a sworn deposition that DeVillena never struck a police officer with his car, nor was he driving at an officer when police opened fire.

""There was no need for self-defense. There was nothing they needed to defend themselves from,"" Diggins told The Desert Sun in June.

The DeVillena shooting is currently under examination by the Riverside County District Attorney's Office, where it has been for about a year. DA spokesman John Hall said earlier this month the office had received ""new information"" about the shooting, but he refused to provide any more details.

DeVillena's family has filed a lawsuit in federal court, but the suit is stuck in a holding pattern, waiting for a decision from the DA's office.

Nordman and Heron were put on administrative leave after the shooting, but both officers were back on duty by the start of January. Less than two weeks later, Nordman fired at the fleeing car on South Camino Real.

In that shooting, police had set up a stakeout outside an apartment complex, watching a parked car, hoping to catch suspects from a recent home burglary. Police officers descended on the car as two men climbed inside. Although the passenger was captured, the driver sped off, prompting three officers to fire down the street, inadvertently hitting Meza, the bystander.

According to the Palm Springs Police Department, officers at the scene shot at the car because the driver backed the vehicle into three officers — seriously injuring them — before he drove off.

It is not clear which officer fired the bullet that struck Meza, but public records confirm that Nordman was one of the officers who fired.

Palm Springs Police Department policy discourages officers from shooting at a moving vehicle, which the policy manual says is ""rarely effective."" Officers are only supposed to fire at a vehicle if it is heading toward them and there is no way to get out of the way, or if there is another threat of deadly force — like a gun pointed out the window — directed at the officers or others.

Despite this policy, officers fired on the fleeing car. Abraham, a nearby resident, was watching the news at home when he heard echoes from down the street: Pop, pop, pop.

Abraham's partner said someone must have been lighting firecrackers, but Abraham — who had been raised in a house with firearms — recognized the unmistakable crack of gunshots.

He stepped out of his front door to investigate. A man's voice came from the street.

""I've been shot!"" the man shouted.

Abraham peered over the wooden gate at the edge of his yard. Meza sat on the curb, a police officer tending to his wound, a yellow Labrador by his side. Blood pooled on the asphalt.

During an interview on Monday, Abraham questioned why police fired their guns at all. Even if a burglary suspect had backed into the officers with his vehicle, he was no longer a threat once he started to drive away. Abraham asked: Why would police risk a shootout on a residential street?

""I can't put myself in their place, I don't understand the fears they face, and I know it would be a terrible world without them,"" Abraham said. ""But on the other side of it, it seems like every time we turn around … I hear about somebody — who probably shouldn't have been shot — being shot by a police revolver.""

Meza, who has filed a lawsuit against the police department, could not be reached for comment. A settlement is under discussion in the lawsuit.

The fleeing driver was Juan Lopez Villanueva, 18, who had gotten out of jail only eight days before.

After escaping from the police on South Camino Real, Villanueva drove to Cathedral City, where he was spotted again by police, then hid in his house in a standoff with officers. Eleven hours later, Villanueva surrendered to officers, no longer able to withstand the pain of a single bullet wound, according to the police department. Officers found a loaded gun in his car.

Villanueva has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges.

The Palm Springs Police Department declined to answer any questions about the DeVillena shooting in 2012 or the Meza shooting in 2013. Because the police union has taken the city to court in an effort to halt the release of officers' names, the police department is the subject of a temporary court order that forbids them from releasing any information about any police shootings.

Nordman could not be reached for comment.

Gunfire in Desert Hot Springs

In Desert Hot Springs, Officer Miguel Preciado fired his gun in two shootings in less than a year.

The first shooting occurred on Oct. 27, 2012, when Preciado and other officers encountered an aggressive dog. According to the police department, the ""vicious pitbull"" had trapped a man inside of his car, prompting him to call police for help. Police tried to control the animal, but when it charged at officers, Preciado and another officer opened fire, killing the dog.

The officers followed the policy of the police department, the agency said.

Although the shooting occurred nearly two years ago, it has never been previously reported by The Desert Sun or other local media, suggesting the Desert Hot Springs Police Department withheld information about the shooting after it occurred.

Ten months later, during a short car chase on Aug. 22, 2013, Preciado fired his gun again.

The chase began when Desert Hot Springs police spotted a stolen car on Hacienda Avenue. After a brief chase, two suspects jumped out of the vehicle at El Cajon Drive, then fled on foot toward La Mesa Drive. Preciado confronted one of the suspects, Eulizez Rodriguez, 24, then shot him to death. Rodriguez was a previously convicted gang member with a pending warrant for drug and gun crimes.

Neither the Desert Hot Springs Police Department nor the Riverside County Sheriff's Department would say what prompted Preciado to open fire or if Rodriguez had a weapon when he was shot.

The sheriff's department, which was called in to conduct a criminal investigation, said it could not comment on the shooting because the Riverside County District Attorney's Office is still reviewing their findings.

Preciado could not be reached for comment.

Steve Quintanilla, an attorney for the Desert Hot Springs Police Department, said privacy laws forbid him from disclosing whether Preciado followed department policy when he shot Rodriguez.

Robert Carrasco, a sheriff's deputy at the Jurupa Valley Station, is the only officer among the desert police departments or the sheriff's department to have fired his gun in three shootings since 2009.

Carrasco fired his weapon while responding to two shootings and a report of a stolen car. The sheriff's department said Friday that all three shootings were in accordance with the law and department policy.

• On Sept. 24, 2010, deputies responded to a report of a shooting on Hastings Boulevard in Glen Avon, where they found an injured woman. When a man at the scene refused to drop a handgun, Carrasco and five other deputies opened fire. Francisco Ortega, 34, of Glen Avon, died at the scene. Although the shooting happened nearly four years ago, his name was not released until Friday.

• On Jan. 23, 2013, Carrasco shot at a stolen sedan after a short car chase on Wagon Train Lane in Jurupa Valley. A 17-year-old boy received a non-threatening bullet wound. The sheriff's department said Friday that Carrasco shot the teen because the suspect ignored orders to stay in the sedan and keep his hands in view. When the teen opened the car door, Carrasco shot him. The teen had a knife, the department said.

• Five months later, on June 25, 2013, Carrasco was one of several deputies who responded to a reportof a shooting on 45th Street in Jurupa Valley. At the scene, a man in a vehicle accelerated at a group of officers, prompting Carrasco and four other deputies to fire at the oncoming car. The driver, Anthony Thompson, 34, was killed.

In a statement, the sheriff's department said it has a strict policy about use of force, and all shootings are closely evaluated to ensure they are ""necessary and consistent with the public trust.""

In a shift of opinion in recent weeks, those surveyed by 44%-41% say the U.S. bears a responsibility to ""do something"" about the violence. That's a shift from last month, when by 55%-39% a majority saw no U.S. responsibility to act.

That change could reflect news coverage of the plight of thousands of Yazidi refugees who fled advancing Islamic State forces only to become trapped on Mount Sinjar, at risk of dying from exposure, hunger and thirst. On Thursday from Martha's Vineyard, President Obama announced that U.S. airstrikes and humanitarian aid had succeeded in easing that crisis.

""It's interesting that this long after we've been involved in a country like Iraq that is so controversial, we still find people changing their minds,"" says Christopher Gelpi, a political scientist at Ohio State University who studies public opinion toward military conflicts. The percentage of Republicans, conservatives, and people 50 and older who see a responsibility rose by double digits compared with the July survey.

Even Americans who see a responsibility to act are worried about an expanding commitment less than three years after the United States withdrew combat troops. Fifty-one percent are more concerned that the U.S. will go too far in getting involved. About a third, 32%, say their greater concern is that the U.S. will not go far enough in stopping the Islamist militants.

Views differ sharply across age groups.

Those under 30 are less likely to approve of airstrikes than older Americans are, and they are much more likely to express concern about the risks of an expanding U.S. engagement in Iraq. By more than 3-1, 18-to-29-year-olds worry more that the U.S. will get too involved. Those 65 and older are about evenly divided between concerns over whether the U.S. will go too far or not do enough to stop the militants.

The telephone survey of 1,000 adults, taken Thursday through Sunday, has a margin of error of +/-4 percentage points.

Obama returned to the White House from his vacation early Monday morning to meet with Vice President Biden and top national security advisers about Iraq. The United States has widened airstrikes to help Kurdish fighters trying to retake the Mosul Dam from the Islamic State forces. On Monday, U.S. fighters, bombers and drones conducted 15 airstrikes, the U.S. Central Command said.

Since Aug. 8, the U.S. has conducted 68 airstrikes in Iraq.

Most Americans, 54%-31%, approve of the airstrikes. That is a bit lower than public support for NATO airstrikes in Kosovo in 1999 and U.S. airstrikes against Iraq and Afghanistan in 1998 and 1999.

""The public attitude seems to reflect very much the kind of attitude that you heard from Obama when he was justifying the airstrikes,"" Gelpi says. ""The president was very much in sync in feeling we ought to try to do something but we shouldn't do too much. Whether the president is leading the public, or whether the president has his finger in the wind and understands where the public is at, is hard to say.""

Fifty-two percent say they are following news stories about the airstrikes ""very closely"" or ""fairly closely."" While that's higher than the 49% paying attention to the continuing friction between Russia and Ukraine, it's lower than the 57% paying close attention to the aftermath of the police shooting in Ferguson, Mo., and the 58% tracking the Ebola virus breakout in West Africa.

USAToday,usa150,http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/josh-moon/2014/08/19/va-hospitals-employee-standards-cracked/14299565/,VA hospital's employee standards all cracked up, Josh Moonjmoon@gannett.com@josh_moon ,08/19/2014,01/18/2016,"What does it take to be fired from a VA hospital?

I don't ask that because of some sadistic hope that someone might be fired, but simply because I'd like to know. Every week we take another step down the ladder of unbelievably bad behavior and learn that, no, that despicable act also is not a firing offense.

So far, we've gone through falsifying wait lists in order to keep sick vets waiting longer for care, collecting bonuses for meeting wait-time goals you falsified and not reading X-rays and then just copying old info into charts. None of those was enough to result in anyone getting fired at the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System in Montgomery.

So, what would get someone fired? I mean, what's the craziest, most off-the-wall thing we could think of here? Something so crazy that probably no one would even do it, but if by some miracle they did, there would be no way they couldn't be fired immediately.

Like, what if a person working in the VA's drug addiction treatment program took a patient to a crack house and helped him buy crack?

Fired or not fired?

Not fired.

I know, because as unbelievable as it might seem, that actually happened.

According to a story by the Advertiser's Kala Kachmar, who has turned the CAVHCS inside out over the last few weeks, an investigation by the VA found that an addiction treatment employee took a patient to a known drug dealer's home, helped the patient secure illegal drugs and then left the patient there overnight.

The VA employee is still listed in the hospital's employee directory over a year after the incident was discovered and isn't on the list of employees who have quit, retired or been fired.

This latest embarrassment for CAVHCS comes a day after center director James Talton's op-ed in the Advertiser, in which he praised the work he and his staff have done to correct problems and improve care.

Talton said he wanted to ""clarify"" information that had been presented in recent media reports. But first, he discussed the good work that's managed to lift the center's rating in VA's system from a one-star to a two-star score in quality and from a two-star to a three-star score in efficiency.

What Talton is referring to is the VA's Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning (SAIL) five-star rating system. And while it's true that the CAVHCS did improve, the numbers used to generate those scores include ratings based on, among other factors, a facility's wait times, timely and effective treatment of ailments and the use of medical imaging. All numbers Talton's facility has been accused of manipulating.

That's like Bernie Madoff saying, ""Yeah, but look how great the hedge fund's earnings were.""

Look, I don't want to come down on Talton too hard here. The guy's only been there a couple of years. Maybe he walked into a catastrophe and actually is trying to do the best he can.

But the VA system is a mess, and it didn't get this bad overnight. The horrible practices and understaffing have been going on for years, despite funding for the VA going up dramatically under the Obama administration.

That means that not only have we been providing horrible care to our vets, we've been spending more to do it.

It's disgraceful. The incompetence and indifference it took to put VA facilities in this shape is almost unimaginable. And it's certainly unimaginable that those who should've been guiding the ship didn't notice.

The fact is a lot of people knew there were problems, but because there was no public outcry and no scrutiny, they did nothing to fix the problems. They went to work, collected a check and turned a blind eye to the problems.

And you can feel this heading that way again. The VA stories have slipped off the front pages in most cities and the nation has moved on to Ferguson and other hot stories.

We can't allow that to happen. This is one story that needs to stay out there. It needs other reporters like Kachmar spotlighting the problems. And it needs public outrage and public interest.

Because we know what happens when no one is watching.

Caroline tells us a little more about the track, which bears a serious message:

Blood On Your Bootheels was written from the perspective of a young black man in America and how impossible it seems for him not to get swept up in a culture of violence. The song was inspired by the Trayvon Martin case, and given what all's happened since — in Ferguson and (elsewhere) — I don't think I could make my point any better. Racism and violence fuel each other, they're ingrained in our cultural structure, so now it seems the only thing to do is to rebuild the structure.

USAToday,usa153,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/18/james-jeffords-vermont-senator-dies/14232413/,"James Jeffords, ex-senator who broke with GOP, dies","Sam Hemingway, The (Burlington, Vt.) Free Press ",08/18/2014,01/18/2016,"BURLINGTON, Vt. — James Merrill Jeffords, who was a {Republican congressman and senator}<hyperlink=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/18/james-jeffords-dies/14229425/""> before breaking with his party in 2001, has died. He was 80.

Jeffords, the last Republican to hold federal office elected from Vermont, retired from the U.S. Senate in 2006 while in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. He had been cared for at a facility near Washington, D.C.

News of Jeffords' death Monday morning quickly spread across the state and the nation.

President Obama took time from the situations in Ferguson, Mo., and in Iraq, site of a war Jeffords opposed, to express his sympathies.

""During his more than 30 years in Washington, Jim never lost the fiercely independent spirit that made Vermonters, and people across America, trust and respect him,"" Obama said in a statement. ""Whatever the issue — whether it was protecting the environment, supporting Americans with disabilities, or whether to authorize the war in Iraq — Jim voted his principles, even if it sometimes meant taking a lonely or unpopular stance.

""Vermonters sent him to Washington to follow his conscience, and he did them proud.""

""The passing of Senator Jim Jeffords will be felt throughout Vermont and our country,"" Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin said in a statement. ""We need more like Senator Jeffords. My heart goes out to his children and extended family.""

Early Monday afternoon, Jeffords' son and daughter issued a statement about their loss.

""While we are saddened by our father's passing, we take comfort in the knowledge that he lived a full life, from the hills of Vermont to the halls of Congress,"" they said. ""We will miss his kindness, his good humor, and his generosity of spirit.""

Jeffords was regarded as a maverick in Washington even before he split from the Republican Party in 2001, decried the party's rightward shift and criticized what he saw as President George W. Bush's political intransigence on a number of issues.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who became a senator in 1974, the same year Jeffords first was elected to the U.S. House, issued a statement lamenting Jeffords' passing.

The two men had been unspoken rivals during part of their time together in Washington, but they also worked closely on dairy and other issues.

""He was a partner in our work for Vermont, and he was a friend,"" Leahy said. ""He was a Vermonter through and through, drawn to political life to make a difference for our state and nation. Part of his legacy will also stand as an enduring chapter of the Senate's history.""

U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement that he and his wife are mourning Jeffords' death.

""Jim was one of the most popular elected officials in the modern history of the state — serving at the local, state and federal levels. Vermonters admired him because of his low-key and down-to-earth qualities, and because of his obvious and strong love of the state and the Vermont way of life,"" Sanders said.

""In 2001, he displayed enormous courage by leaving a party that, he often said, had left him because of its dramatic move to the right. Jim was a friend and he will be sorely missed,"" Sanders said.

Jeffords' decision to become an independent rocked the nation by giving control of the Senate to the Democrats, costing his Republican colleagues their committee chairmanships.

""I have changed my party label, but I have not changed my beliefs,"" Jeffords said in his May 24, 2001, speech at a Burlington, Vt., hotel in which he explained his decision to leave the GOP.

""Indeed, my decision is about affirming the principles that have shaped my career. I hope that the people of Vermont will understand it. I hope in time that my colleagues will as well. I am confident that it is the right decision.""

The move made Jeffords a national figure, praised by Democrats and vilified by Republicans. He appeared on the cover of Newsweek magazine and later authored two books, an explanation of his decision entitled My Declaration of Independence and a 2003 memoir, An Independent Man.

Back in Vermont, he was a hero. His decision to leave the GOP spawned a ""Thanks, Jim"" bumper sticker and a special-edition beer called ""Jeezum Jim,"" a reference to his modest nature and Vermonty accent.

""In 2001, the world saw what his fellow Vermonters already knew: Jim Jeffords, above all, had the courage of his convictions,"" U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said in a statement Monday.

Others, including close friends and some Vermont Republican leaders, were distraught about the 2001 decision.

""I was very upset over it,"" James Johnston, a former Jeffords campaign adviser and close personal friend, told the Burlington Free Press on Monday. ""But I know he had good reason to do it at the time.""

Johnston became emotional describing the loss of his old friend.

""I guess I knew this day was coming,"" he said, choking up as he spoke. ""I'm not so sure I'm ready to deal with it.""

Jeffords, the son of a Vermont Supreme Court justice, grew up in Rutland, studied at Yale University, received his law degree from Harvard University and entered politics in 1966, winning a race for state Senate from Rutland County.

Two years later, he was elected attorney general, and soon he became embroiled in a fight with International Paper's plant in Ticonderoga, N.Y., regarding the discharge of mercury-laden sludge into Lake Champlain.

Jeffords ran for governor in 1972, but many in the party resented his liberal political positions on the environment and other matters, and he lost a bitter primary battle to Luther Hackett, a business-oriented Republican.

Hackett lost to Democrat Tom Salmon in the general election. Two years later, Jeffords won the state's lone U.S. House seat when incumbent Rep. Richard Mallory ran for U.S. Senate.

Jeffords won the next six re-election contests to the House, then won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1988 when Sen. Robert T. Stafford, R-Vt., another Republican moderate, retired.

In his last years as an independent caucusing with the Democratic Party, Jeffords continued to take issue with Bush, particularly in the area of foreign affairs.

""I regret that my departure from Congress, like my arrival, finds our country at war,"" Jeffords said in his 2006 farewell speech on the Senate floor. ""Young and even not-so-young Americans are sacrificing life and limb, while the rest of us are making little or no sacrifice.""
