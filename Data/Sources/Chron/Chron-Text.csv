Despite these assurances, there were numerous reports of police firing tear gas into crowds marching toward a police command center on Sunday night, hours before the curfew was set to be imposed.

The bullets that entered his body did not appear to have been fired from very close range, according to the report.

An autopsy conducted by local officials had still not been completed.

Clashes between protesters and police had calmed as the week progressed, but they ramped up again over the weekend.

""With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard. We will not use a curfew tonight,"" Nixon said in the statement.

Witnesses reported police firing tear gas into crowds marching toward a police command center on Sunday night. Echoing what Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson told reporters early Monday morning, Nixon said protesters threw Molotov cocktails and fired gunshots at law-enforcement officers. Nixon said a civilian had also been shot Sunday night.

""Again, I join the people of Ferguson, and all Missourians, in strongly condemning the violent acts we saw last night, including the firing upon law enforcement officers, the shooting of a civilian, the throwing of Molotov cocktails, looting and a coordinated attempt to overrun the unified Command Center,"" his statement continued.

""We are all frustrated and looking for justice to be achieved regarding the shooting death of Michael Brown.

In an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday morning, Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson accused reporters of swarming around agitators, giving ""them a platform and glamoriz[ing] their activity.""

""We have a lot of media that have not done a great job. Last night, when crowds were walking and small groups — and they got larger, and they were just walking — and then when a certain element — that criminal element, that got out here with masks on, that wanted to agitate and build up the crowd, would stop in front of the media — the media would swarm around them, give them a platform and glamorize their activity,"" Johnson said, according to {a Mediaite video}<hyperlink=”http://www.mediaite.com/tv/cpt-johnson-some-of-the-media-glamorizing-ferguson-violence/”> of the interview.

When the media promotes the disruptive protesters, Johnson argued, the more violent demonstrators rush to the scene.

""And then before we knew it, the crowd was 100. Now it’s 200. Now it’s 300,"" Johnson said. ""And now those criminals began to start throwing things out of the crowd that was standing within the media.""

Johnson was recently named to manage the police response to the protests, which began when 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed during an Aug. 9 encounter with police. The demonstrations have also resulted in an aggressive police crack down. Officers have repeatedly arrested journalists covering the event, including {four reporters and photographers}<hyperlink=”http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/four-more-journalists-arrested-monday-ferguson”> Monday night.

Johnson also made sure to praise another segment of the media — but ""not all,"" he was sure to note — which he felt has been doing its job responsibly.

""We had a number of journalists — and not all, I want to say that now — the journalists have been on our side, they have been our partners in reporting,"" he said. ""You know I get home each morning, I look at the news and I am really grateful to the media for what they’ve done.""",0,NA,NA,NA

Tapper displayed a sense of disgust when describing the overall absurdity of the situation, especially the police's show of force toward protesters who didn't appear to be doing anything threatening. He twice compared the situation to times he reported from a war zone in Afghanistan.

""""The protesters have moved all the way down there,"""" Tapper said on air, pointing to a clear distance between police and protesters.  """"Nobody is threatening anything. Nobody is doing anything. None of the stores here that I can see are being looted. There is no violence.""""

Tapper then took his cameraman to examine the police's show of force.

""""Now I want you to look at what is going on in Ferguson, Missouri — in downtown America, OK?"""" he said. """"These are armed police, with semi-automatic rifles, with batons, with shields, many of them dressed for combat.

Absolutely, over the last nine days there's been violence. But there is nothing going on on this street right now that merits this scene out of Bagram. Nothing.

The compound, actually a solid suspended in liquid droplets, is a nerve agent that works by switching on pain receptors, which tell your brain when something hurts.

After 20 seconds of exposure, protestors in Ferguson would have experienced a tightening in the chest and painful stinging in the nose and eyes, {according to the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine}<hyperlink=”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539444/”>. People who are tear-gassed have a burning sensation in their throats and cough, wretch, and sometimes vomit.

Business Insider's politics editor, Hunter Walker, who was hit with tear gas while covering 'Occupy Oakland' protests in 2011, describes being ""suddenly gripped by a pain so intense, I nearly fell to my knees.""

""The most overwhelming aspect of the pain was an intense tightness in my chest. It felt like my heart might burst or collapse into itself and it was so bad I thought I might be having a serious medical issue,"" he {wrote}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-what-its-like-to-get-tear-gassed-2014-8?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals#ixzz3AriRxUnQ”>.

When tear gas and smoke is fired from canisters, there's also a risk of serious injury if protestors are hit with the canisters.

An {Iranian study}<hyperlink=”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23365472”> during protests in 2008 and 2009 found that canister impacts caused 18 cases of severe bleeding and fractures, leading to at least three amputations. They aren't small and can explode after hitting the ground.

An American made tear gas canister fired by Israel in Palestine

What to do if tear gassed

Medical professionals dealing with tear gassed patients have no specific antidote for the toxins used — all they can do is get them out of the area and wash the gas from their eyes and other affected areas using sterile saline. If the patients are injured in other ways, doctors run into trouble when performing surgery — the swelling in the throat can make it {impossible to intubate them}<hyperlink=”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11183362”>, so they can't breathe if they need to be sedated.

Palestinian activists give advice to Furguson protesters over Twitter

After police in Ferguson fired the gas on protestors last week, activists in Palestine offered advice on twitter:

""Keep calm when you're teargassed, the pain will pass, don't rub your eyes!"" West Bank resident Mariam Barghouti tweeted.

Doctors advise immediately moving as far away from the gas as possible to minimize exposure.

If you are hit with tear gas, take out your contact lenses and use lots of saline or water to rinse affected areas. Not rinsing thoroughly can spread the chemicals further.

After mild exposure, symptoms should subside after 10 to 15 minutes, but after moderate or high exposure, symptoms can take several hours to die down. Skin irritations and breathing difficulties can last days, and you should seek further treatment.

When someone isn't at the top of their health game, the effects of tear gas can be way worse. Children, the elderly, women who are pregnant, or anyone with an underlying respiratory illness or heart condition should seek medical attention as soon as possible after being hit.

Four police officers, including a Lieutenant Colonel, were convicted of manslaughter over the incident.

Unknown consequences

Dr Vincent Iacopino from Physicians for Human Rights told Business Insider the long term effects of tear gas remain unknown.

""It is important to understand that, in many countries, large populations have been exposed to significant levels of tear gas for periods of days to weeks. The long term effects of such long-term exposures have not been studied,"" he said.

Iacopino did tell us that tear gas can be used safely, but ""the fact that it is commonly misused increases the possibility of severe injuries and/or death.""

The compounds used in tear gas were developed during the First World War and used alongside other more deadly chemical weapons, such as mustard gas and chlorine.

The effects of the chemical warfare were so horrific that many of the nations which deployed them in the First World War had agreed on a ban, the Geneva Gas-War Protocol, by the time the Second World War flared in 1939.

Tear gas is banned under the 1993 international Chemical Weapons Convention which has been adopted by by 190 countries including the United States, however, the treaty only covers international conflict, and not domestic use.",0,NA,NA,NA

A riot can be many things.

It can be an act of communal madness, reflecting the emotional imbecility of those who believe the best way to express joy at their ball team's win is to overturn a car.

It can be an act of opportunism, a chance, under cover of darkness, influence of chaos, suspension of order, to smash and grab and run away, arms heavy with loot.

And it can be an act of outcry, a scream of inchoate rage.

That's what happened this week in Ferguson, Missouri. The people screamed.

To believe that this carnage - the windows smashed, the buildings torched, the tear gas wafting - is all about the killing of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion%2Foutlook&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Michael+Brown%22”> is to miss the point. Brown, of course, was the unarmed 18-year-old African-American man shot multiple times by a Ferguson police officer on Saturday.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar - Ferguson Police asked his department, as an outside agency, to investigate the shooting (the Missouri governor on Thursday relieved the St. Louis County police of their Ferguson policing duties) - has said Brown was walking with another individual when a so-far unnamed officer sitting in a police car, stopped him. According to Belmar, the officer was trying to get out of his car when one of the two individuals pushed him back inside, where there was a struggle over the officer's weapon and at least one shot was discharged. He says the officer came out of the car and fired, striking Brown, who was about 35 feet away, multiple times.

Witnesses say Brown, who was to have started college this week, had his hands up when he was shot. Police have not said why the officer felt the need to stop him in the first place.

Details are still too sketchy for us to draw hard conclusions about what happened that afternoon. But it is all too easy to understand what happened afterward and why good people should be paying attention.

Because, again, this is not just about Brown. It's about {Eric Garner}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion%2Foutlook&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Eric+Garner%22”>, choked to death in a confrontation with New York City Police.

It's about {Rodney King}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion%2Foutlook&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Rodney+King%22”>.

And it is about the bitter sense of siege that lives in African-American men, a sense that it is perpetually open season on us.

And that too few people outside of African America really notice, much less care. People who look like you are every day deprived of health, wealth, freedom, opportunity, education, the benefit of the doubt, the presumption of innocence, life itself - and when you try to say this, even when you document it with academic studies and buttress it with witness testimony, people don't want to hear it, people dismiss you, deny you, lecture you about white victimhood, chastise you for playing a so-called ""race card.""

They choke off avenues of protest, prizing silence over justice, mistaking silence for peace. And never mind that sometimes, silence simmers like water in a closed pot on a high flame.

One can never condone a riot. It is a self-defeating act that sells some fleeting illusion of satisfaction at a high cost in property and life.

But understanding this does not preclude recognizing that the anger we see in Ferguson did not spring from nowhere, nor arrive, fully formed, when Michael Brown was shot. It is the anger of people who are, as {Fannie Lou Hamer}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion%2Foutlook&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Fannie+Lou+Hamer%22”> famously said, sick and tired of being sick and tired.

Last night, law enforcement broke up the protest with brutal force: confronting demonstrators in riot gear and armored vehicles, arresting journalists, and firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowds,"" the congressmen wrote. ""These incidents raise concerns that local law enforcement is out of control and, instead of protecting the safety and civil liberties of the residents of Ferguson, is employing tactics that violate the rights of citizens and hinder the ability of the press to report on their actions.""

Conyers, Scott, and Cohen cited three isusues they said were highlighted by the situation in Ferguson.

Firstly, they said the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown on Saturday, which started the protests, was part of ""a continuing pattern of the use of deadly force by police against unarmed African Americans."" Secondly, they pointed to what they described as a ""series of troubling arrests in Ferguson."" Specifically, the congressmen pointed to the arrests of two reporters and an alderman from St. Louis, Missouri on Wednesday evening. However, in addition to these three specific incidents, they cited reports they described as having raised ""questions about the legitimacy of all arrests made during the course of these protests. Lastly, the congressman said Ferguson has highlighted the need to ""address the extensive militarization of state and local police.""

""The use of overwhelming force by police against unarmed citizens requires our urgent attention,"" the congressmen wrote. ""It is imperative the Committee convene to examine these issues as soon as possible.""

The tag has come to prominence in the days since the shooting death of Michael Brown Jr. in Ferguson, Missouri. Brown was just 18 years old.

Brown, who was unarmed, was shot Saturday by a Ferguson police officer while walking with a friend down the center of the street. Police have said a scuffle broke out after the officer asked the boys to move to the side. Witnesses say Brown's arms were in the air — in a sign of surrender — as a white policeman repeatedly shot the black youth.

NONE In The Back: Brown Autopsy Shows He Was Shot In The Front Of The Body
Daily Caller

One of the first pictures to be made public of Brown showed him scowling and wearing headphones, which for a teenager in America is pretty standard.

Since his death the city of Ferguson has been plagued byviolent protests and looting.

The hashtag seeks to bring to light what some call a media bias against young black people. Their argument is that the media uses pictures of slain black men and women that show them looking quote “thuggish” or angry, instead of other available photos, they say, which would paint them in a more positive light given the circumstances.

#IfTheyGunnedMeDown has now gone viral, with Twitter users sharing their own thoughts and pictures about the Brown shooting, and also harkening back to the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in early 2012.

More than 100 people marched through the streets of Oakland and Berkeley and on the UC Berkeley campus on Friday evening, protesting police brutality in solidarity with those in Ferguson and calling for justice in the name of Bay Area victims of violence at the hands of law enforcement.

Protesters broke windows and damaged property in both cities.

Two arrests were reported in Oakland. A 45-year-old Oakland man was taken into custody for allegedly assaulting an officer, and a 41-year-old Hayward man was arrested on suspicion of obstructing police.

In Berkeley, police arrested {Taylor Tengwall}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Taylor+Tengwall%22”>, 24, of Berkeley for allegedly resisting arrest and {Lael Montgomery}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Lael+Montgomery%22”>, 19, of Vallejo on suspicion of trying to remove a weapon - not a gun - from an officer and resisting an officer.

Don't shoot!""

Police presence was heavy, with officers in riot helmets carrying long batons, but the march was mostly peaceful except for several tense moments. Police faced off with protesters near a freeway on-ramp and, at one point, someone discharged a noxious spray, causing many to cough. The origin of the spray was unclear.

Oakland police on scene said they did not use any chemical agents, and several officers were affected by the spray, according to Sgt. {Holly Joshi}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Holly+Joshi%22”>, chief of staff for Chief {Sean Whent}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=bayarea&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Sean+Whent%22”>. One officer suffered a back injury, she said.

""The majority of protesters were committed to being peaceful. However, there were elements in the crowd intent on committing acts of vandalism and attempting confrontation with officers,"" Joshi said.

Whent said his officers acted with ""tremendous restraint"" and ""exhibited a high level of professionalism.""

As night fell, a few protesters with covered faces pulled out paint cans and hammers and sprayed antipolice graffiti on buildings along the march route and broke some windows of businesses on Telegraph Avenue.

Drivers along the way, sitting in cars blocked by the marchers, honked in support, eliciting cheers from the crowd. At one point, aerial fireworks were set off near 14th Street and Broadway, bringing more whoops and hollers from the rowdy protesters.

For his efforts, protesters poured liquid down his back. ""Smells like urine,"" Guerra said, but it had the strong burn of alcohol.

""These people are just local business people,"" Guerra said. ""Like over there, Youth Radio? They broke their windows last time. They're a nonprofit. They're not trying to hurt anybody.""

Guerra is a plumber who services local Oakland businesses. He said he had an equal beef with the police not doing more to stop the vandalism.

""That?"" he said, gesturing to a helicopter above. ""That's not helping anybody. They're spending millions of dollars, but what are they doing?""

The march was billed as a ""F- the Police"" action by organizers, but ""FTP"" meant different things to different people.

According to their accounts, the two were accosted by police, some in militaristic riot gear, demanding identification and ordering them out. These officers refused to provide their badge numbers or names or a reason for the order and grew angry when one of the men attempted to take a video.

Both reporters were arrested. Reilly says a cop intentionally banged his head against the glass on the way out of the restaurant, then gave him a facetious ""apology.""

The two were transported to a lockup. No mug shots were taken, no fingerprints collected, no paperwork done. After some minutes, they were released. The men were told they'd been arrested for ""trespassing.""

At a McDonald's. Where they were customers.

""Apparently, in America, in 2014,"" tweeted Lowery, ""police can manhandle you, take you into custody, put you in cell and then open the door like it didn't happen.""

Actually, both men had been treated with a heavy-handedness and official contempt that are apparently all too familiar to black people in Ferguson - and to black and poor people of whatever tribe all over America. In arresting reporters for reporting, Ferguson police raise a pressing question: Just what are they trying to hide?

The same night Reilly and Lowery were handcuffed, after all, a local alderman who had posted video of the protests to social media was arrested. All last week, we had reports of news photographers being ordered to stop taking pictures and reporters being tear-gassed. One officer reportedly took a TV camera and pointed it to the ground.

The street in question, to judge from television images, is a quiet one. We're not talking Broadway at rush hour.

Johnson said the officer reached out of the car and grabbed Brown when the struggle ensued, the two men wrestling through the car window as a shot was fired. Then the officer got out. Another witness, {Tiffany Mitchell}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion%2Foutlook&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Tiffany+Mitchell%22”>, said Brown had broken away and was facing the officer with hands up when he was shot.",37,NA,NA,NA

Chron,chron21,http://www.chron.com/default/article/Here-s-When-Cops-Are-Justified-In-Using-Force-5698507.php,Here's When Cops Are Justified In Using Force Against Protesters,Drake Baer,08/19/2014,02/24/2016,"Ferguson, Missouri, {is chaotic once again}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/ferguson-protests-police-tear-gas-michael-brown-shooting-death-2014-8?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals”>, more than a week after a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old who was unarmed. 

After a few nights of relative peace, tear gas and stun grenades are part of the news as protestors assemble and police disperse them. 

This onslaught of chaos raises the question of when and how police officers should use force. 

Within the police studies community, it's agreed that every encounter between police and citizen is ""defined by the potential for the officer to use force,"" Mike White, a criminologist at Arizona State University, tells Business Insider. ""For the citizen, for the officer — (force) is an underlying theme."" 

Yet while the specter of force is always present, it's rarely used in the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics {has found}<hyperlink=”http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=251”> that force is only used in 2% of all police-citizen encounters. In the case of encounters that result in arrests, that number bumps up to 20% of the time. 

So what's happening in Ferguson? 

""When things are about to boil over,"" White says, the appropriate tactic is ""a show of force rather than use of force.""

This translates as a police presence, which he says acts as ""a visual deterrent"" to violence, looting, and other criminal acts that can happen when frustrated people gather.  

Cops are taught what level of force to use by their police departments, usually decided on as a state policy. White says most of the time this policy is taught as a ""use of force continuum,"" which the National Institute of Justice {defines as}<hyperlink=”http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/Pages/continuum.aspx”> ""an escalating series of actions an officer may take to resolve a situation.""

Here's {the NIJS example of the appropriate use of force}<hyperlink=”http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/Pages/continuum.aspx”>: 

• Officer Presence: No force is used• Verbalization: Force is non-physical.• Empty-Hand Control: Officers use bodily force to gain control of a situation.• Less-Lethal Methods: Officers use less-lethal technologies to gain control of a situation.• Lethal Force: Officers use lethal weapons to gain control of a situation. 

White says the point is to use the ""least amount of force necessary to accomplish the objective, usually to resolve police-citizen encounter peacefully.""

In Ferguson, the use of force has escalated with the behavior of the crowds. University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist David Klinger says that if protesters are throwing Molotov cocktails, bricks, and rocks — as has {reportedly been the case in Ferguson}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/ferguson-protests-police-tear-gas-michael-brown-shooting-death-2014-8?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals”> — then using higher degrees of force is appropriate. 

But ""some of it doesn't make any sense to me,"" he says, ""like pointing lethal rifles at the crowd — there's things (that the police in Ferguson) are doing that have me and my colleagues scratching our heads."" 

Another element in the escalation: how militarized the police have become,{a topic that Business Insider has dived into here}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals”>. ",0,NA,NA,NA

Bringing in the National Guard — which is an actual military force — may do little to help quell the ongoing civil unrest. Protesters and outside observers continue to be outraged over the Ferguson Police Department's use of military-grade equipment to deal with protesters who are mostly unarmed.

However, there is a long history in the United States of governors, and at times even the president, deploying the National Guard to help put down riots or seemingly uncontrollable demonstrations. Events in Ferguson are an echo of some of the tensest moments of the Civil Rights Movement — and hearken back to some of the most notorious moments in recent American history.

Here are the most noteworthy deployments of National Guard troops throughout the U.S. in recent decades: 

1957: Little Rock, Arkansas: President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in a historic move, federalized the National Guard and deployed them to a southern state for the first time since the Civil War. The troops were used to forcefully integrate Little Rock Central High School and protect black students from rioters. 

1962: Oxford, Mississippi: President John F. Kennedy followed his predecessor's lead and federalized the Mississippi National Guard to prevent violence against the first black students attending the University of Mississippi. 

1964: Rochester, New York: Governor Nelson Rockefeller called in the New York National Guard to put down riots that started after allegations of police brutality surfaced in the city.

1965: Selma, Alabama: President Lyndon Johnson federalized the Alabama National Guard in order to protect peaceful civil rights protesters marching from Selma to Montgomery. A previous attempt at a march had ended with police brutally beating protesters. 

1968: Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; and 

Washington, D.C.: President Johnson federalized the Michigan, Illinois, and District of Colombia's National Guards in response to riots that erupted following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. National Guard troops under state control were also sent to several other major metropolitan areas in order to respond to the civil unrest after King death. 

1970: Kent, Ohio: Ohio Governor James Rhodes sent the National Guard to Kent State University to quell a series of anti-Vietnam protests on the campus. The deployment of the guard led to the infamous Kent State massacre, in which four students were killed after the troops opened fire. 

1992: Los Angeles, California: Riots erupted in Los Angeles after the acquittal of police officers who were videotaped brutally beating Rodney King. President George H. W. Bush federalized the California Army and Air National Guards in an attempt to end the riots and bring order to the city. 

1993: Waco, Texas: During the siege of the Branch Dravidian compound in Waco, Texas, elements of the Alabama and Texas National Guard were called in to assist operations being conducted by the ATF and the FBI. The compound burned down under controversial circumstances, and 91 people were killed in the standoff.

1999: Seattle, Washington: Governor Gary Locke called in the Washington National Guard in an attempt to restore order in the face of massive riots during a World Trade Organization meeting. ",0,NA,NA,NA

The police were a key proponent for the red-light cameras that Houstonians eventually rejected. They've also advocated for the surveillance cameras that monitor practically every corner downtown. It isn't clear how effective cameras are at preventing crime, though a camera did catch Houston Police Chief {Charles McClelland}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion%2Feditorials&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Charles+McClelland%22”> hitting a pedestrian with his car in a crosswalk last year.

HPD is less fond of the cameras, however, when they're in the limelight. As of last year, only a fraction of patrol cars were outfitted with dashboard cameras. In 2012, HPD announced it would begin a program to outfit 100 officers with body cameras that could track their every action. Not exactly an impressive number, out of more than 5,000 officers.

Society entrusts police with a monopoly on force, and civilians should be able to maintain an ever-watchful eye on the people charged with keeping the peace. New technology can make this easier than ever, but it is an indictment of HPD's own practices that out of 121 instances between 2008 and 2012 when an officer shot a civilian - a quarter of whom were unarmed - not one was captured on a dashboard camera.

While departments such as HPD may have a love-hate relationship with the prolific use of cameras, the police in Ferguson, Mo., seem to have a vendetta against recording devices. There was no dashboard camera to capture the fatal police shooting of {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion%2Feditorials&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Michael+Brown%22”>, an unarmed black teenager. There was no gaggle of local news cameras to report on the name of the officer who fired that shot - police are still keeping his identity secret.

When national news outfits traveled to Ferguson with their own cameras, police began arresting journalists. Washington Post journalist {Wesley Lowery}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=opinion%2Feditorials&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Wesley+Lowery%22”> even recorded his own arrest.

According to Obama the U.S. military ""almost flawlessly"" completed the humanitarian mission to protect the members of the Yazidi religious minority who were beseiged by jihadists affiliated with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS or ISIL) on a mountain in the northern part of the country. 

""We broke the siege of Mount Sinjar,"" Obama said.

Last week, Obama {authorized two military operations in Iraq}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-vows-to-continue-iraq-airstrikes-if-necessary-2014-8?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals”>, an effort to protect Americans in the city of Erbil as ISIS advanced on the city and what he described as a ""humanitarian mission"" to aid the Yazidis. 

According to Obama, the military launched airstrikes against ""ISIL targets around the mountains"" that enabled ""thousands of people"" to evacuate from Mount Sinjar. He also said the military conducted air drops of food and water ""every night."" Due to the success of these missions, Obama said he did not ""expect"" there would be additional helicopter evacuations on the mountain and that it would be ""unlikely"" the Yazidis would need more air drops. 

Though he described the humanitarian mission on Mount Sinjar as largely successful Obama noted the ""situation remains dire for Iraqis subject to ISIL terror around the country."" He reiterated his prior statements that the situation in Iraq will improve if the country forms a more ""inclusive"" government without former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Obama said he was ""modestly hopeful"" the situation with Iraq's government would improve now that the country appointed a new prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, on Monday.

Benjamin Crump, a family lawyer, said at a news conference Monday morning that the mother of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9, had a lingering question.

""What else do we need to give them to arrest the killer of my child?"" Crump said Brown's mother asked.

The autopsy, performed by Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner for New York City, {revealed}<hyperlink=”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?_r=1”> that Brown had been shot at least six times, including two times in the head, during the fatal police encounter slightly more than a week ago.

Attorneys representing the family argued that the wounds, notably one they said indicated Brown was shot while his head was bent forward, provided evidence that the officer should have indeed already been arrested.

""We believe given those kinds of facts, that this officer should have been arrested. Those things speak for themselves,"" said another family lawyer, Daryl Parks. ""Why would he have been shot in the very top of his head — 6-foot-4 man, makes no sense.""

Professor Shawn Parcells, who also conducted the autopsy, said the arm wounds could have been sustained while Brown's hands were up in a surrendering position.

""It could have occurred when he was putting his arms up,"" he said. ""We don’t know and we still have to look at other aspects of this investigation before we really start piecing things together.""

(AP) — A candlelight vigil for a young unarmed black man who was fatally shot by a suburban St. Louis police officer was followed by unrest as crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted officers who tried to block access to parts of the city.

Nearly three dozen people were arrested after tensions erupted following a candlelight vigil Sunday night for 18-year-old {Michael Brown}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=news%2Fnation&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Michael+Brown%22”>, who police said was unarmed when he was shot multiple times Saturday in a scuffle with an officer in Ferguson.

The investigation into what led to the shooting was ongoing, but Ferguson Police Chief {Tom Jackson}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=news%2Fnation&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Tom+Jackson%22”> told {The Associated Press}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=news%2Fnation&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22The+Associated+Press%22”> on Monday that the FBI was taking over the case and that he welcomed the move.

Streets upended on Sunday night were relatively quiet early Monday, with some debris littering the area but crowds largely dispersed.

St. Louis County police spokesman {Brian Schellman}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=news%2Fnation&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Brian+Schellman%22”> said 32 people were arrested for various infractions including assault, burglary and theft. Schellman said two officers suffered minor injuries and that there were no reports of civilians hurt.

Several businesses were looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer, and carted rims away from a tire store. Some climbed atop police cars as the officers with riot shields and batons stood stoic nearby, trying to restrict access to the most seriously affected areas.

Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, said he was convinced the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they had used Brown's death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal.

""Most came here for a peaceful protest but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. ... I can understand the anger and unrest but I can't understand the violence and looting,"" Trout, 53, said.

Pat Washington, a spokeswoman for Dooley, said tear gas had been used. Authorities would not immediately confirm media reports of gunfire.

One of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who fought with the officer.

The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known and that all shell casings at the scene matched the officer's gun. Police were investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.

Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged and it wasn't clear if he was armed.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV there's no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn't yet put to use.

Jackson said blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer who shot him. Toxicology tests can take weeks to complete.

Earlier Sunday, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters. Some marched into an adjacent police building chanting ""Don't shoot me"" while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn't use force; the crowd eventually left.

Brown's mother, {Lesley McSpadden}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=news%2Fnation&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Lesley+McSpadden%22”>, said she didn't understand why police didn't subdue her high school graduate son with a club or stun gun, and that the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted.

""I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,"" she said, fighting back tears.

The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old {Trayvon Martin}<hyperlink=”http://www.chron.com/search/?action=search&channel=news%2Fnation&inlineLink=1&searchindex=gsa&query=%22Trayvon+Martin%22”> by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges.

Ferguson's population of about 21,000 people is almost 70 percent black. The race of the officer has not been disclosed. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.

""Today — with our support — Iraqi forces took a major step forward in their operations to recapture the largest dam in Iraq,"" Obama said during a statement from the White House, where he addressed both ongoing U.S. military operations in Iraq and the {unrest in Ferguson, Missouri}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-statement-ferguson-protests-iraq-michael-brown-2014-8?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals”>.

The Pentagon said that it had conducted 15 airstrikes Monday near the Mosul Dam, the country's largest dam that provides electricity and water to a large portion of the country. The U.S.'s airstrike campaign has helped Iraqi and Kurdish forces to {wrest back control of the dam from ISIS fighters}<hyperlink=”http://www.businessinsider.com/iraqi-forces-retake-control-of-mosul-dam-after-heavy-us-airstrikes-2014-8?utm_source=hearst&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=allverticals”>. Since Aug. 8, the Pentagon said, the U.S. has conducted 68 airstrikes in Iraq — 35 of them coming near the Mosul Dam.

Obama said that if ISIS militants had breached the dam, it could have had ""catastrophic"" consequences for U.S. personnel in the country — and for the country as a whole.

He cited the operations to recapture the Mosul Dam as proof that Iraqi and Kurdish forces could work together for the better of Iraq, and said if they continue to do so, they will have the ""strong support"" of the United States. He praised statements from Haider al-Abadi, who last week was named to the role of prime minister.

Obama pledged to continue to work with the new Iraqi government and U.S. allies on ""long-term strategy"" to counter ISIS militants in the region. But he warned Iraqi politicians that U.S. aid did not represent a signal to ""let the foot off the gas return to the same kind of dysfunction that has so weakened the country generally.""

""Dr. Abadi has said the right things. I was impressed in my conversation with him about his vision for an inclusive government,"" Obama said.

""But they’ve got to get this done because the wolf’s at the door and in order for them to be credible with the Iraqi people, they’re going to have to put behind some of the old practices and actually create a credible united government.""",0,NA,NA,NA
