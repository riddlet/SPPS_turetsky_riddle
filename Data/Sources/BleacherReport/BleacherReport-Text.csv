Over the past week, the Missouri town of Ferguson has made the national news after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer. Residents have protested the local police force in a situation that has become violent, as explained in {USA Today}<hyperlink=”http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/”> and KSDK-TV's timeline of the event.

According to Robert Klemko of The Monday Morning Quarterback, via {Peter King}<hyperlink=”http://mmqb.si.com/2014/08/18/san-francisco-49ers-levis-stadium-debuts/5”>, the Rams have decided to provide a gift for local high school teams attempting to focus through this troubling time:

Watching the violence over Michael Brown's killing unfold in Ferguson last week, a Rams staffer thought of the high schoolers, specifically, the boys who are supposed to play in their first football game of the season this weekend. Rams manager of fan development & alumni relations Kyle Eversgerd put in a call to coaches at McCluer High, McCluer North and McCluer South; there would be 75 free tickets awaiting each team if they chose to come to Saturday’s preseason game at the Edward Jones Dome.

""In light of everything going on it just kind of hit me,"" says Eversgerd, whose job includes outreach with local high schools. ""I can't imagine with all that stuff going on, how tough it must be to practice. We were able to get them away from it all.""

St. Louis hosted the Green Bay Packers in its second preseason game of the season Saturday. The Packers ended up winning 21-7 as both teams attempt to prepare for the start of the 2014 regular season.

The Rams' next scheduled preseason game takes place this Saturday on the road against the Cleveland Browns before their final preseason game against the Dolphins in Miami, which is scheduled for Thursday, Aug. 28.

While the tickets do not solve much of the problems within the community, it likely became a welcome distraction for young kids who have a lot on their mind.

As the situation continues to unfold in Ferguson, hopefully this gesture from the Rams organization had a positive effect on its nearby residents.",28,NA,NA,NA

As street protests and a militarized police presence continued for the fifth horrific day in Ferguson, Mo., Wednesday, {FiveThirtyEight.com}<hyperlink=” http://fivethirtyeight.com/”> founder Nate Silver tweeted a little story about an encounter he had with the police “a couple years ago.” He described being arrested and held briefly when he declined to leave the scene of an arrest he’d stopped to watch.

The eight-tweet story concluded with Silver apologizing to the cops, having his takeout burrito returned to him, and being given a ride home.

Gawker’s {Michelle Dean}<hyperlink=” http://michelle-dean.kinja.com/”> wrote about the story. Here’s the headline: {Nate Silver, Inspired by Ferguson, Tells Idiotic Arrest Story}<hyperlink=” http://gawker.com/nate-silver-inspired-by-events-in-ferguson-tells-idio-1621363315”>.

Disclosure: I’ve never met Nate Silver, but we know each other virtually. We’ve exchanged emails and possibly a phone call or two over the years, mostly because we played in the same fantasy baseball league in the ’00s. I can’t say I know Nate well at all, but I’ve interacted with him some and we have quite a few friends in common. My impression is that he’s a pretty good guy.

I don’t know what he was trying to do with those tweets, but I’d be willing to bet he wasn’t trying to equate his “suffering”—an hour of inconvenience and worry, plus having to eat a cold burrito—with that of the people of Ferguson. If I had to guess I’d bet he was trying to make a point about overzealous police, or how intimidating it can be to be ordered around. Or something.

But the thing is, I’d have to guess. For a while, I was waiting for a ninth tweet, one that acknowledged that, however scary that experience was, it was nothing compared to what the people of Ferguson were going through, or that his white skin gave him the option of clearing everything up with an apology. Or something. (Update: Something like the latter is what Silver said in a {longer apology}<hyperlink=”http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/nate-silver-apologizes-ferguson-burrito-arrest-story.html”> he later gave to New York Magazine.)

But the feed fell silent, leaving people to wonder what the heck Silver was thinking, with many, including Gawker, assuming the worst.

{Silver apologized}<hyperlink=”http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/nate-silver-apologizes-for-ferguson-tweets-193951#.U-0A7BxHVhI.twitter”> in a trio of tweets Thursday morning, saying he’d have more to say later:

Is it always a bad idea to comment about breaking news? Of course not. Is it always a bad idea to comment about racial issues, which are at the forefront of the Ferguson story? Of course not. Is it always a bad idea to comment about a situation where people have been killed or injured? Of course not.

But these are all situations that require an extra moment of thought, and then another and another. When things are moving fast, or when sensitive subjects are involved, you have to think through the implications of what you’re going to say.

Could what you’re about to say reasonably be taken the wrong way? Could it damage your credibility in some way? And is it worth the risk? Are you adding something to the conversation or just popping off?

You can delete a tweet—which, to Silver’s credit, he did not do in this case—but you can’t make it go away completely. You can count on someone capturing a screenshot of it.

You can’t anticipate every reaction to everything you might possibly say, and we all step in it sometimes, even a guy as smart as Nate Silver. But thinking, and thinking hard, about what you say around potentially controversial subjects is always a good idea.",0,NA,NA,NA
